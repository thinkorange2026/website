// Phase 10 (audit). Every route is prerendered to static HTML, so the module
// script is needed for HYDRATION only — never for first paint. Vite emits it
// ahead of the stylesheet, which on a throttled connection means the ~158KB of
// JS competes with (and delays) the 13KB of render-blocking CSS that FCP
// genuinely waits on. Measured at 3.4s FCP on mobile throttling before this.
//
// Two changes, both cheap and both only valid BECAUSE the HTML is prerendered:
//   1. the stylesheet is moved ahead of the script, and
//   2. the script is dropped to `fetchpriority="low"` so the CSS and the fonts
//      win the bandwidth race. Execution order is unchanged — a module script
//      is deferred either way — so hydration still runs after parse.
//
// Fonts are preloaded because after (2) they are the next thing gating a
// *final* paint: `font-display: swap` means text paints immediately in a
// fallback, but LCP is re-recorded when the real face swaps in. Only the two
// Satoshi cuts that body copy and headings actually use are preloaded; the
// serif and mono faces are decorative and can arrive late.
