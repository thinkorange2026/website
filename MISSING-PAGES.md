# Missing Pages

Tracks routes that exist in `nav.js` (so they render and are linkable) but
have no written T2/T3 content file yet. Not a blocker doc — nothing here
stops other work — just a punch list so a gap doesn't go unnoticed.

Raised 17-08-2026, from `thinkorange-services-menu.html` (Clinton's revised
services mega-menu). That file's own visual design was **not** implemented —
only its content (category names, groupings, service names) was taken and
used to restructure `serviceCategories` in `src/content/nav.js`. Every route
below already renders today: T2 leaves fall back to `ServiceLeaf.jsx`'s
`PendingLeaf` state, and the one new T3 hub falls back to `CategoryHub.jsx`'s
tolerant no-content branches (hero + child grid + CTA, no intro/FAQ/why-us).
Nothing is broken or a 404 — this is a writing backlog, not a bug list.

## Services — ✅ resolved 18-08-2026

All 9 new/gap service leaves now have real, researched T2 content, and the
new Registrations & Licences hub has its `category-content.js` entry
(intro/FAQ/why-us, including the carried-over DPIIT FAQ). Written this
session: `iec-registration`, `icegate-registration`, `trademark-registration`,
`ngo-darpan-registration`, `gst-lut-export-refunds`, `trust-society-section8`,
`pf-esi-registration`, `payroll-processing-returns`, `roc-annual-compliance`,
and `personal-finance` (closing the pre-existing gap noted in
`src/content/services/index.js`'s own header comment). `msme-udyam` and
`startup-india-dpiit` had already moved into Registrations & Licences with no
content changes needed. Every new statutory fact carries a researched source
in `statutory.js`; every new ThinkOrange turnaround estimate landed in
`turnaround.js` as `value: null` per this repo's standing discipline.
`npm run lint`, `npm run content:check` and `npm run build` all pass (27 of 31
service leaves now written), and a live dev-server pass over all 9 new leaves
plus the new hub confirmed real content renders with zero console errors.

**One item stays unwritten, correctly:** `notices-assessments` (Income Tax) —
⛔ blocked the same way as `itr-filing`, `tax-planning-advisory` and
`tds-compliance` (see `BLOCKERS.md` §1, Income Tax Act 2025 renumbering, now
updated to track all 4). Do not write this content until that resolves.

**Open questions this batch surfaced** — none block rendering, every page
above is live today, but each needs CA/CS sign-off before launch, same as
every other item in `CONTENT-REVIEW.md`:
- Whether the Tamil Nadu Public Trusts Act, 2020 has been notified into force
  (`trust-society-section8.js` assumes not — public sources are genuinely
  ambiguous).
- Salem's actual Professional Tax slab table (`payroll-processing-returns.js`
  states the mechanism only, no rupee figure — two sources gave conflicting
  numbers even for Chennai's own slabs).
- The EPF wage ceiling (₹15,000) — an August 2026 proposal to raise it to
  ₹25,000 was reported but not yet notified as law.
- GST Rule 96A(1)(b)'s services-realisation window (`gst-lut-export-refunds.js`
  states 1 year per the Rule) against RBI/FEMA's separate 15-month general
  export-realisation extension.
- The ICEGATE "one AD code registration covers every port" claim — sourced,
  but customs circulars in this area move often.
- NGO Darpan's verification turnaround — sources split 7–15 vs 15–30 working
  days; the site states the latter with the conflict flagged in `statutory.js`.
- AOC-4/MGT-7's late-filing penalty amount — pre-existing gap (already
  flagged in `private-limited-company.js`), still unresolved.

## DSC & eSign — ✅ resolved 18-08-2026

Raised 17-08-2026, from `thinkorange-dsc-menu.html` (Clinton's revised DSC &
eSign mega-menu) — same discipline as the Services section above: content
only, that file's own visual mockup was not implemented.

All 3 new T4 products and both new T5 pages now have real content, researched
from SVS DigiCorp's live product pages (`svsdigicorp.com` — a real DSC
reseller, used to confirm what a Combo DSC actually is and how it's
positioned commercially) plus the Wikipedia eSign (India) article and several
DSC-industry sources for renewal/re-issue mechanics and the eSign-vs-DSC
comparison. Written this session:

- **T4** (`src/content/dsc/products.js`): `combo-dsc`, `dsc-renewal-reissue`,
  `aadhaar-esign` — all follow `class-3-individual`'s existing shape exactly,
  no template changes needed. `aadhaar-esign` sets `validityOptions: null`
  and `driverSlugs: []`, which `DscProduct.jsx`'s existing optional-chaining
  already skips cleanly (no token, no multi-year validity — this product is
  genuinely a different mechanism from every certificate on the page, not a
  DSC variant, and the copy says so explicitly rather than blurring the two).
- **T5** (new files `src/content/dsc/validity-renewal-faqs.js` and
  `esign-or-dsc.js`, no schema existed for either — one had to be designed):
  `validity-renewal-faqs` reads each product's `validityOptions` straight off
  `dscProducts` rather than duplicating the data (same "select by reference"
  discipline as the homepage FAQ row and the Documents Required page — a
  future validity change on any product stays correct here for free) and adds
  a renewal/re-issue/revocation explainer plus FAQs; `esign-or-dsc` is a
  comparison table + decision guide + FAQs. `UtilityPage.jsx` gained two new
  dispatch branches and render functions (`ValidityRenewalFaqs`, `EsignOrDsc`)
  for these — the "add a template dispatch branch" work this section always
  said would be needed, not just a content file.
- `DscHub.jsx` needed zero changes — it already reads `dscProducts` and the
  documents/drivers grid directly, so all 7 products and both new T5 pages
  appeared automatically once the content existed.
- **The single most important fact on both new comparison-style pages,
  double-checked against multiple sources:** Aadhaar eSign does NOT substitute
  for a Class 3 DSC on statutory portals (income tax, GST, MCA21/ROC,
  e-tendering/GeM) — those mandate Class 3 specifically and reject eSign
  outright. Stated plainly on `aadhaar-esign`'s own product page (in
  `verificationNote`, which renders as a prominent callout) and again on the
  `esign-or-dsc` comparison table, so a reader can't miss it on either page.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both pass; a live dev-server pass over
  all 5 new routes plus `/dsc` itself confirmed real content renders with
  zero console errors. DSC content has no `content:check`-equivalent schema
  validator (pre-existing — see this file's Phase 7 note in `CLAUDE.md`), so
  verification here was manual: read-through plus the live render pass.

**Open questions this batch surfaced**, none blocking (every page renders
live today), each worth a vendor/CA confirmation before launch:
- Whether a specific tender/portal's encryption-certificate requirement
  applies to a given bid — `combo-dsc.js` deliberately doesn't claim GeM
  itself requires one (SVS DigiCorp's own site doesn't list GeM under its
  combo product), only that "many e-tendering portals" do; check the actual
  tender before assuming either way.
- The Aadhaar eSign delivery mechanism described (via the existing eMudhra/
  SignX partnership) is an inference from that partnership already existing
  for DSC issuance, not a confirmed fact that ThinkOrange currently offers
  eSign through them specifically — confirm before this page implies a
  concrete delivery channel that isn't actually set up yet.

### Navbar restructure (Clinton's explicit request, done — not a content gap)

- "Partner With Us" removed from the primary navbar (desktop `primaryNav`
  and the mobile menu's flat link list) and replaced with a premium promo
  card inside the DSC mega panel/mobile accordion (`dscPartnerPromo` in
  nav.js, rendered by `MegaPanel.jsx`'s `PanelPromo` and `MobileNav.jsx`'s
  `PromoCard`). The underlying `/partner-with-us` page is untouched and
  still reachable from that card, the footer, and search/direct links.
- "DSC" relabelled "Digital Signatures" in both the desktop and mobile nav.
- **Worth Clinton's confirmation, not yet acted on:** the revised menu's
  "Buy DSC Tokens" subtitle reads "HYP2003 · mToken · InnaIT" (copied
  verbatim into the mega panel as a per-item note) — but `buy-tokens`'s own
  product page content (`products.js`) still centres entirely on HYP2003 and
  doesn't mention mToken or InnaIT at all. If the actual stocked token
  brands changed, that page's `tokenNote`/copy should be updated to match;
  left alone for now rather than guessed at.
- **"Partner login"** (the promo card's secondary link) has no backing
  portal — nothing on this site authenticates a partner — so it's routed to
  WhatsApp instead. Revisit if a real partner portal is ever built.

---

## Total

Both sections on this page are now resolved. The only thing left in the
entire punch list is `notices-assessments` (Income Tax), which is genuinely
blocked rather than missing — see `BLOCKERS.md` §1. Nothing else to do here
until that clears; this file can stay as a historical record of what the
17-08-2026 menu restructure required and how it was closed out.

Follow this repo's standing content discipline on anything written in the
future: research statutory facts, don't recall them; route every figure
through `statutory.js`'s `s()` and every ThinkOrange turnaround estimate
through `turnaround.js`'s `t()`; `fees` stays `null`; run `npm run
content:check` (T2 leaves) or a live render pass (DSC/T4/T5, which has no
schema validator) before considering a batch done.

---

## Income Tax — ✅ resolved 19-08-2026

The four Income Tax leaves (`itr-filing`, `tds-compliance`,
`tax-planning-advisory`, `notices-assessments`) are written. They were never a
menu-restructure gap — they were held by BLOCKERS.md §1 until the Income Tax
Act 2025 section mapping was researched. **Every service leaf in nav.js now has
content: 31 of 31.**

Still owed on them, and tracked in BLOCKERS.md §1 rather than here, because it
is a review task and not a writing task: CA sign-off on the whole
`INCOME TAX ACT, 2025` block in `statutory.js`, plus a decision on the two facts
deliberately left unpublished (reassessment limitation periods, and the
first-appeal form number).

## DSC — research items (02-09-2026)
Not blockers; both are facts deliberately withheld rather than guessed.

- **Class 2 discontinuation.** `ThinkOrange_DSC_Hub_V7.html` states "Class 2
  certificates were discontinued by the Controller of Certifying Authorities in
  January 2021." That is a dated regulatory fact and needs a `statutory.js` key
  with a source before it can be asserted. The Class 2 FAQ on `/dsc/resources`
  currently states only the practical position ("Class 3 is the only class
  still issued"), which needs no citation.
- **DSC issuance turnaround.** `turnaround.dscIssuanceTurnaround` is still
  `value: null`, so the hero spec row and every finder result render "Confirm
  with us". V7 shows "[X hrs]" — its own placeholder. Confirm a real figure
  with Clinton and it appears in both places at once.

## DSC token — research + confirmation items (02-09-2026)
- **Token price.** `tokenProduct.price` is `null`, so the Buy Token page reads
  "On request" and the order form quotes on reply. Set a real number (and say
  whether it includes GST) and the per-unit cost, the live total and the tax
  note all turn on with no code change.
- **"Version 3 tokens, per CCA guidelines."** eMudhra's purchase-token page
  states this; it is a dated regulatory requirement and needs a `statutory.js`
  key with a source before we assert it. The page currently says only that the
  token must be a compliant crypto token and that ours is FIPS-compliant, which
  the DSC tree already asserts elsewhere.
- **Payment.** Ordering routes to WhatsApp. A real "Proceed to Pay" needs a
  backend, a payment provider account and API keys — none of which exist — plus
  a written privacy policy, since a checkout would collect billing and shipping
  addresses. All five legal pages are still `sections: null`.

## Partner programme — confirmation items (02-09-2026)
From `thinkorange-dsc-usecase-pages.html`, which flags these itself:
- **Commission percentage.** The reference's own note argues that "on request"
  loses against competing SignX partner pages that publish a figure, and
  suggests publishing a floor ("Up to X%") rather than a full slab table. A
  commercial call, not a content one. `earnings.rows[].margin` is `null` until
  then.
- **Retail price ranges** per certificate in the earnings table
  (`earnings.rows[].retail`, all `null`).
- **Login activation time** once KYC is complete.
- **Whether an opening balance or advance applies** to a partner account, and
  whether any resubmission charge applies on a rejected application. The FAQs
  currently say both are confirmed in writing during onboarding.
- **"We issue for government and PSU work ourselves"** — carried over from the
  reference as Clinton's own claim; worth confirming it is safe to state
  publicly before launch.

## Certifying authority name (02-09-2026)
No CA is named anywhere on the site — Clinton removed SignX ("it is for the
other company name") and then eMudhra with it. Every DSC and partner surface
now says "a licensed Certifying Authority".
- CONTENT-PLAN.md §9 still instructs the opposite (lead with the partnership as
  the strongest verifiable credential). That section is superseded and should
  be amended, or it will send the next writer back to the old wording.
- If a CA is ever to be named again, it needs Clinton's explicit go-ahead — all
  three supplied reference documents name one, so a future copy-paste from them
  will reintroduce it silently.

## Aadhaar eSign product page — no content, no template (03-09-2026)
`/dsc/esign-or-dsc` was unpaused on 03-09-2026 and is live. Its sibling —
`/dsc/aadhaar-esign`, the T4 product page — was **not**, and cannot be by
uncommenting anything:

- Its content lived in `src/content/dsc/products.js`, **deleted on 02-09-2026**
  when the USB-token offer was removed and the whole T4 family retired.
- `DscProduct.jsx` was deleted with it, so there is no template either.

So restoring it is a content-writing job plus a template decision, not a pause
flag. Until then the eSign menu column carries ONE item, and
`DscEsign.jsx`'s "which one do you need" section routes eSign enquiries to
WhatsApp rather than to a page that does not exist.

⚠️ **Still open, and it is a claim rather than a route:** the paused clauses in
`content/dsc/hub-content.js` ("…renewals, USB tokens and Aadhaar eSign — issued
through…") were left paused deliberately. Restoring them asserts that
ThinkOrange *delivers* Aadhaar eSign today, which this repo has already flagged
as an unconfirmed inference from the DSC partnership existing. Confirm with
Clinton before uncommenting them. Same for the `aadhaar-esign` entry in
`content/dsc/icons.js` and the paused insights article.

## ⛔ DSC content conflict: does one Class 3 Individual certificate cover EPFO and company GST? (03-09-2026)
The finder was rebuilt on 03-09-2026 from Clinton's `dsc-finder-preview.html`.
Its `filings` answer states — in the reference's own wording, now live on /dsc:

> One certificate covers all of these, whether you are a proprietor, a company
> or an LLP — these portals verify the signatory, not the entity, so no
> organisation documents are needed.

`portalGuide` (`content/dsc/certificates.js`), rendered **further down the same
page**, says the opposite in two rows:

- **GST portal** — "Individual for proprietors; Organisation for companies and
  LLPs… Mandatory for companies and LLPs."
- **EPFO / ESIC** — "Class 3 Organisation… A personal certificate will not work
  — EPFO validates against the establishment record."

Both cannot be true, and /dsc currently asserts both. The reference is newer and
is Clinton's own, so it is what the finder implements; `portalGuide` was left
untouched because reconciling them is a factual call, not a formatting one.

**Decide which is right, then fix the loser.** If the reference is right,
`portalGuide`'s GST and EPFO rows and `class-3-organisation`'s `usedFor` list
need rewriting. If `portalGuide` is right, the `filings` card has to split by
signer like `tender` and `exim` do (the machinery already supports it — remove
`skipsSigner` and add `filings|individual` / `filings|company` / `filings|firm`
answers).

## Confirm the token's FIPS 140-3 certification (03-09-2026)
The site now says "FIPS 140-3 compliant" in 20 rendered places, on Clinton's
instruction (03-09-2026), where it previously said the vaguer "FIPS-compliant".

**FIPS 140-3 is a specific NIST standard revision** — it superseded FIPS 140-2 —
so this asserts the HYP2003 token validates against that particular revision,
not merely that it is a compliant crypto token. That is a stronger and more
checkable claim than the one it replaces.

Nothing to fix today: it is the founder's own statement about his own stocked
hardware. **Worth doing before launch:** get the vendor's certificate or CMVP
number on file, so the claim can be backed if a client or a certifying authority
asks. If it turns out the token is certified to 140-2 rather than 140-3, every
occurrence has to change back together — they all resolve from
`content/dsc/certificates.js`, `content/dsc/token.js`,
`content/partner-with-us.js` and `home/sections/DscBand.jsx`.

## Token Initialisation & Reset Tool — three things still needed (03-09-2026)
Added to `/dsc/drivers` on 03-09-2026 as `initialisation-tool` in
`content/dsc/drivers.js`. The page renders it honestly today, but three facts
were deliberately left blank rather than guessed:

1. **The exact vendor tool name.** It is listed as "Initialisation & Reset Tool",
   which describes what it does. If the manufacturer's utility has a specific
   name, use it — a reader searching for the real name should find this page.
2. **Which operating systems it runs on.** `supportedOs` is an empty array, so
   the row reads "Utility · sent on request" and the panel shows no
   compatibility table. Most vendor initialisation utilities are Windows-only,
   but that was not assumed here.
3. **The file itself.** `downloads` is empty, like every driver `url` on the
   site. Given that running this on the wrong token destroys a live certificate,
   sending it person-to-person may be the right permanent answer rather than a
   gap — that is Clinton's call.

Fill any of the three and the page picks it up with no code change: the
compatibility table, install steps and a real download button all render as soon
as their arrays are non-empty.

⚠️ Do not add `installSteps` unless the procedure has actually been confirmed
for this utility. The panel currently shows "When it is used" (situations)
precisely because a procedure was not available to state.


## HYP2003 initialisation tool — hosted 04-09-2026, moved 05-09-2026

Clinton supplied `public/software/HYP2003_Initialization_Tool.exe` (234,128
bytes, PE32 GUI / Intel 80386 / MS Windows) and asked for it wired as a
download.

⛔ **It has moved twice; the CURRENT and correct home is the Initialisation &
Reset Tool entry.** It was wired there first (the filename says so), moved to
**HYP2003** on 04-09-2026 ("software link is for this"), and moved back on
05-09-2026 — Clinton: *"that software i have put in public is for reset tool. so
remove from hyp2003 and keep at reset tool."* HYP2003 has **no hosted file** and
renders its `sourceNote` again.

⚠️ **It is published ONCE and must stay that way.** The same executable listed
under two names is how someone downloads the wrong thing, and this one erases
certificates.

✅ **A consequence worth knowing, and it is an improvement:** the reset entry
carries `warning`, and `DriverPicker` never turns a `warning` entry's hero pill
into a direct download — it links to the panel, where the warning renders above
the button. While the file sat under HYP2003 it was one click from the hero with
no warning between. Verified 05-09-2026: 0 direct downloads in the hero row,
exactly one `a[download]` on the page, and `warningBeforeDownload: true`.

⚠️ **Still worth confirming: is there a separate plain DRIVER installer for
HYP2003?** The page currently says the driver ships with the token and is
published by the manufacturer. If a redistributable installer exists, send it
and HYP2003's Windows row fills in with no code change.

⛔ **Needs a human answer, not a guess:**

1. **Redistribution terms.** CONTENT-PLAN.md §9 says not to host a vendor binary
   without checking them. The file is now hosted and served from our own domain.
   Confirm we are permitted to redistribute it — this is the one item on this
   list that is a legal question rather than a copy gap.

Still outstanding on that entry, and rendering honestly meanwhile:

2. **The exact vendor tool name.** The entry is labelled "Initialisation & Reset
   Tool" (generic); the filename says "HYP2003 Initialization Tool". If the
   manufacturer has a real product name, it belongs in `label`.
3. **A version number and release date.** Both are still `null` — the filename
   carries neither. Fill `downloads[0].version` / `.releaseDate` and the panel
   renders them with no code change.
4. **macOS / Linux builds**, if they exist. `supportedOs` on the reset entry
   states Windows only, which is read off the binary rather than assumed, and
   the entry deliberately lists **no null rows** for the other two — a null row
   makes the page say that build "is not hosted here", which would assert we
   expect one to exist.

⚠️ **If the file is ever replaced, the SHA-256 in `drivers.js` must be
recomputed** (`shasum -a 256 public/software/HYP2003_Initialization_Tool.exe`).
A checksum that does not match the file it labels is worse than none — it tells
a careful reader the download has been tampered with.

## About HYP2003 page — three things to confirm (05-09-2026)

New page `/dsc/about-hyp2003` (T14), built from Clinton's supplied
`thinkorange-token-page.html`. Nothing below blocks the page — it renders and
reads correctly today — but each is a claim I could not settle from the
document alone.

### 1. ⛔ The FIPS 140-3 deadline has no CCA circular behind it

The source document carries "21 September 2026" as a bare literal AND attaches
its own warning to it: *"verify the 21 September 2026 date before publishing.
The commercial argument on this page depends on it."* It is now
`statutory.js` → `fips1403DscIssuance`, interpolated with `s()` everywhere,
never typed.

What was actually established by research:

- **The underlying NIST date is solid and primary-sourced.** 21 September 2026
  is when NIST's CMVP moves every FIPS 140-2 module validation to its
  Historical list. Source: <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort>
  (`statutory.js` → `fips1402SunsetDate`).
- **The India-specific consequence is NOT.** That Certifying Authorities stop
  issuing new DSCs onto 140-2 tokens from that date is corroborated by several
  independent DSC-industry sources and follows logically from the NIST sunset —
  but **the CCA's own advisory was not located.**

So every sentence on the page is worded as an **expectation** ("are expected
to", "is expected to"), not a certainty. **Get the CCA circular number and the
page can harden its wording; until then, do not.** A compliance firm asserting
a regulatory deadline it cannot cite is the exact failure the statutory-file
discipline exists to prevent — and this deadline is 16 days away as written.

### 2. The datasheet revision was not independently verified

The page renders "Specifications sourced from the HyperPKI HYP2003 datasheet,
HSTE-NB0026 RV 3.1-IND." That reference, and every specification under it
(dimensions, 64 KB, 500,000 rewrite cycles, the standards list, CCA India among
its certifications), comes from Clinton's document. It is kept **because a
checkable document reference is worth more than a vague "per the
manufacturer"** — but a copy of that datasheet should go on file.

⚠️ Related and already open: *"Confirm the token's FIPS 140-3 certification
(03-09-2026)"* above. That item and this page now depend on each other — the
whole page argues the token is 140-3.

### 3. Three claims from the source document were NOT published

Listed so nobody "restores" them from the HTML without a decision:

- **"[Exclusive / Authorised] distributor — [territory]"** (the hero badge). An
  unfilled placeholder *and* an authorisation claim about a commercial
  relationship. Dropped — there is no honest half-version of it. **If
  ThinkOrange is an authorised distributor and can evidence it, say so and it
  goes back in.**
- **"We will confirm current rates and stock the same working day."** A
  turnaround guarantee, on CONTENT-PLAN.md §1.1's hold list. The CTA is worded
  without one.
- **"Distributor pricing"** as a price claim. `fees` is null across the DSC
  tree; the copy says partner rates exist and are quoted on application, which
  `/partner-with-us` already asserts, and names no figure or range.

The document's own two dev notes named a certifying authority. Those are not on
the page and must not be — see *"Certifying authority name (02-09-2026)"*
above.
