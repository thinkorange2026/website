// Phase 9 SSR counterpart to router.jsx — used ONLY by src/entry-server.jsx,
// which in turn is only reachable from scripts/prerender.mjs (a build-time
// Node script, never shipped to the browser). Every template is imported
// EAGERLY here, deliberately duplicating router.jsx's import list rather
// than sharing it:
//
//   - A synchronous SSR pass (renderToString) has no use for React.lazy's
//     async boundary — there is nothing to defer when the whole point is to
//     produce one complete HTML string before the script moves on.
//   - More importantly: if this file's imports were shared with router.jsx
//     (e.g. by having router.jsx import FROM here), Rolldown would see a
//     STATIC import of every template alongside the dynamic ones and bundle
//     them into the main chunk regardless — silently undoing Phase 7's
//     code-splitting fix. Keeping this a wholly separate module means the
//     client bundle never even sees these import statements.
//
// The actual template<->route mapping lives in ONE place regardless —
// routeComponents.js's resolveComponent() — so this file and router.jsx
// can't drift on WHICH template a given route resolves to, only on how
// that template is loaded.
