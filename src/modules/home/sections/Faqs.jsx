// ("accordion, with FAQPage JSON-LD").
//
// SURFACE: light-alt, and that is a cadence decision rather than a taste one.
// This sits directly after DscBand (deep) and directly before Testimonial
// (deep, per DESIGN.md §11.1 row 9). A dark FAQ here would put three
// dark-family sections back to back; light-alt keeps the alternation intact
// both today (Testimonial renders null) and once a real testimonial ships.
//
// Deliberately NO arc rings, unlike the dark sections. The motif is now on
// three sections plus the partner panel, and DESIGN.md §16's closing principle
// is that a designed page applies each effect in one place. Adding it to a
// light section too would make it wallpaper — the same failure mode as
// "icon-in-a-circle everywhere". Depth here is typographic instead.
//
// Content comes from src/content/faqs/home.js, which POINTS AT written service
// leaves rather than restating them. Nothing in this file is a fact.
