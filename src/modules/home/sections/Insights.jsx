// Homepage section 12 — DESIGN.md §11.1 row 10 (Light surface, editorial).
// Still gated on CONTENT-PLAN.md §6 row 12's own bar ("Reserve the route and
// add at 4+ articles"), not just "more than zero" — four real articles now
// clear it, so the section renders.
//
// LAYOUT (Clinton, 19-08-2026): one tall FEATURE panel on the left carrying
// article 1, with its heading and subheading at the panel's foot; the other
// three stacked down the right, each as a numbered plate beside its own
// heading and subheading. Two columns at lg, a single stack below it.
//
// IMAGERY (19-08-2026): each article now carries a real photograph — licensed
// Unsplash contextual stock, IMAGE-PLAN.md §2 TIER 2, no people in any frame,
// sources in src/assets/insights/ATTRIBUTION.txt. They replaced the earlier
// typographic arc plates. Two rules they have to keep obeying:
//   1. Every image goes through <Img> (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable, no bare <img>),
//      which reserves its box so CLS stays at zero.
//   2. Nothing here implies the photo is ThinkOrange's own office, desk or
//      paperwork — §2 permits Tier 2 only for genuinely contextual imagery, and
//      an editorial thumbnail beside a headline is exactly that.
// The feature panel's headline sits OVER its photograph, so it carries a scrim
// (see FeatureCard) and the contrast was measured on rendered pixels, not
// assumed.

              should not be when the section is a blog roll with an "All
              insights" link beside it.

              ⚠️ NOT "Latest articles", which was the obvious choice: `insights`
              is in SOURCE order, not date order, and the section takes the
              first four. "Latest" would assert an ordering the data does not
              guarantee. Sort that array by `published` and the word becomes
              available.

              `headingClassName` is gone with the old copy — the 28ch override
              existed only to break that long headline onto two lines. */}
