// Homepage section 9 — CONTENT-PLAN.md §6 row 9, DESIGN.md §11.9's tone
// ("deliberately plain — this is a service block, not a sales block").
// Light surface, no Card/hover-lift treatment — that restraint IS the point
// here, same reasoning DESIGN.md gives T5 utility pages generally.
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026: the four driver PAGES are gone, and so are three of the four
// DRIVERS — ePass 2003, Watchdata Proxkey and mToken were deleted on Clinton's
// instruction, leaving HYP2003, the token ThinkOrange actually stocks. This
// section therefore stopped being a four-up grid and became what it now
// honestly is: the one token we ship, its driver, and where to buy it.
//
// ⛔ REAL BUG FIXED HERE, and it was live: this linked to
// `/dsc#${dscSectionIds.drivers}`, but `drivers` moved out of `dscSectionIds`
// when the DSC tree split in two — so the key was `undefined` and every card
// pointed at the literal URL "/dsc#undefined". Nothing errors, nothing logs,
// and a link-integrity scan passes it because the PATH is real; only the
// fragment is nonsense. ⚠️ A missing key on a section-id object fails silently.
// Prefer deriving a href from the page object plus its own id map, as below.
//
// Links go to a page, not a raw file: content/dsc/drivers.js
// deliberately holds `url: null` for every platform until the vendor files
// are actually sourced and hosted (BUILD-PLAN.md Phase 7) — see that file's
// own comment. A "download" glyph pointing at a page with the real
// instructions is honest; pointing it at a file that doesn't exist isn't.
