// ⛔ 03-09-2026 (Clinton): "remove the most dsc faq fron by token page and
// create a new page only for dsc faq and keep all the dsc faq there."
//
// ⚠️ THE FAQ SET IS THE SAME UNION Buy Token WAS RENDERING — `certificateFaqs`
// plus `dscValidityRenewalContent.faqs`, in that order, resolved at render
// time. Nothing was rewritten, reordered or dropped in the move, and neither
// array is restated here. A correction to either file reaches this page.
//
// ⚠️ TWO SECTIONS CAME WITH THEM, and that is deliberate rather than scope
// creep. Splitting Buy Token down to its order panel left the issuance steps
// and the validity/renewal guidance with no page at all — and the retired
// `/dsc/validity-renewal-faqs` URL plus the finder's "Renewing or replacing"
// alt link both have to land on a real section. They are reference material
// that answers questions, which is what this page is; the alternative was
// deleting written, reviewed content to satisfy a layout instruction.
//
// ⚠️ The `HowTo` schema moved WITH the steps. Schema has to sit on the page
// that renders what it describes, or it asserts structure the reader cannot
// see — the same rule that moved it off /dsc in the first place.

// Quieter than CtaBand's 0.07/0.12/0.045, which stays the site's one loud
// band. Same ladder the partner page's own dark panel uses.

      {/* ⛔ 04-09-2026 (Clinton), two rounds. First: "Renewal & re-issue
          section reduce the content make as point and fixed the Renewing soon?
          card." Then, on the 7/5 result: "here propotion is not right amount
          show in grid of 2 col and show card as cta button below it."

          So: four points off `renewalPoints` across TWO FULL-WIDTH COLUMNS,
          with the card demoted to a CTA row underneath.

          ⚠️ WHY THE 7/5 SPLIT WAS WRONG, and it was a proportion problem
          rather than a styling one: four short points do not fill a 7-column
          measure, and one small card does not fill a 5-column one — so the
          section ran a narrow ragged list beside ~700px of empty canvas with a
          card floating at the top of it. Nothing scaled with the content.

          ⛔ A CSS GRID, DELIBERATELY — AND THIS REVERSES THE MULTI-COLUMN
          CHOICE, ON INSTRUCTION. Third round, same day: "line is not align
          make it align properly keep as empty space."

          The list was built with CSS multi-column first, because this repo has
          hit the grid row-stretch bug four times ("What's included", "Is this
          you?", "Documents required") — a grid aligns items into ROWS, so a
          two-line point is stretched to the height of the three-line one
          beside it and leaves whitespace under the shorter one. Multi-column
          packs by height instead and has no row alignment at all.

          But that is exactly what made the RULES disagree: with items packing
          by height, the second hairline in the left column landed ~30px below
          the second in the right, and a pair of near-aligned hairlines reads
          as a misprint rather than as a deliberate stagger. Clinton chose
          alignment over tightness, explicitly accepting the whitespace ("keep
          as empty space"). So the row-stretch is now the WANTED behaviour
          here, not the bug — do NOT "fix" this back to multi-column.

          ⚠️ Two things this depends on:
            - The rule sits on TOP of each point. With a bottom rule, a short
              item's hairline would sit at the top of its own trailing
              whitespace and float away from the text it belongs to.
            - `items-start`, so the copy stays at the top of a stretched row
              rather than centring in it.
            - The items are DIRECT children of the `<dl>` (one `Reveal` wraps
              the whole list, never one per item), so they are genuine
              siblings. If a per-item wrapper is ever introduced, that wrapper
              becomes the grid item and any `first:`/`nth-child` exception
              silently matches every item — the trap recorded three times over
              in CLAUDE.md.

          ⚠️ The card is the `.panel-dark` + real-Button pattern CLAUDE.md
          already records for this section, now as a full-width row. It had
          drifted to a filled ember-50 callout with an underlined bare anchor,
          which was wrong three ways:
            1. ember-50 + an ember border is the site's CAUTION treatment; this
               is a next-step CTA, so it read as a warning about renewing.
            2. An underlined text link where every other WhatsApp CTA on the
               site is `Button variant="tertiary"` — the one carrying the
               measured contrast fix (its text is ink-950; white on that green
               is 1.98:1).
            3. No `self-start`, so it stretched to the prose column's height.
               Moot now that it is its own row, but do not reintroduce a
               side-by-side without it.

          ⚠️ `data-surface="dark"` is LOAD-BEARING, not decoration: this is a
          dark panel nested in a light-alt section, so without it every
          descendant reading `var(--surface-accent)` / `var(--surface-border)`
          gets the LIGHT values, and `[data-surface="dark"] h3` never supplies
          the canvas heading colour. */}
