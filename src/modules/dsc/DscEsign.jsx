// /dsc/esign-or-dsc — eSign or DSC, which do you need.
//
// ⛔ BODY COMMENTED OUT, COMING SOON INSTEAD — 04-09-2026 (Clinton: "in esign,
// comment out section and keep as coming soon"). The real PageHero still
// renders (breadcrumb, H1, lede), then `<ComingSoon />` in place of the three
// body sections and the CTA band. Same discipline as the 13-08-2026 client
// preview: the body is commented out IN PLACE, not deleted, so uncommenting
// the JSX below plus its imports at the top restores the page exactly.
//
// Two things went out WITH the sections, deliberately, and must come back
// together with them:
//   1. **The `SubNav`.** Its three tabs pointed at #comparison, #which-one and
//      #faqs — ids that no longer exist on the page. `scripts/prerender.mjs`'s
//      `assertNoDanglingFragments` gate FAILS THE BUILD on exactly that, which
//      is the point: a tab that scrolls nowhere is worse than no tab.
//   2. **The `FAQPage` JSON-LD.** Structured data must never assert content a
//      reader cannot see on the page — the same reason every per-route schema
//      was commented out alongside its section during the client preview.
//
// The rest of this file's original notes still apply once it is restored:
//
//  1. **It is its own module, not a T5 branch.** T5 resolves unconditionally
//     to DscBuyToken (routeComponents.js) since the DSC tree collapsed to two
//     pages, so reusing T5 here would have rendered the Buy Token page under
//     this URL. This page is T11.
//  2. **`dscGroupForSlug` is gone** — content/dsc/groups.js was deleted with
//     the old menu. The hero's texture is named directly. `signature` is the
//     right variant on its own merits, not just because it is what the eSign
//     group used to resolve to: it is the one motif that means "a signature
//     applied", which is what this page is about.
//  3. ⚠️ **The old "Aadhaar eSign" button is GONE, and must stay gone.** It
//     pointed at `/dsc/aadhaar-esign`, a T4 product page whose content was
//     DELETED on 02-09-2026 along with the entire T4 family. Restoring that
//     button means restoring a page and its content first — it is not a
//     one-line change, and a button to a route that does not exist is a 404 in
//     the middle of the one section whose whole job is to send a reader
//     somewhere. The Class 3 button now points at /dsc's finder, which is what
//     actually resolves "which certificate do I need" today.
//
// No `Reveal` on the comparison table: tables never animate (CLAUDE.md), and
// this one is the page's reference content.
