// /dsc/drivers — THE TOKEN DRIVER, ITS INSTALL STEPS AND ITS FIXES.
//
// ⛔ 03-09-2026 (Clinton): "buy token and driver download will be two seperate
// page." This is the driver half, lifted out of Buy Token unchanged — the
// disclosure list, the per-token panel and the "no hosted files yet" note are
// the same components with the same content, on their own URL.
//
// ⚠️ `/dsc/drivers` WAS A REDIRECT STUB until today. Its entry had to come out
// of `dscRetiredRoutes` in the same edit, or `writeRedirects()` would overwrite
// this page's own index.html with a stub pointing at itself. The four
// per-token URLs (`/dsc/drivers/hyp2003` and friends) stay retired and now land
// here.
//
// ⚠️ T5's "no marketing chrome" brief still governs the register of this page —
// it is what a stuck reader opens at 9pm — but `Reveal` is used, as it already
// was in this section when it lived on Buy Token. A texture is one inert SVG
// and costs no request.
export default function DscDrivers({ path = dscDriversPage.path }) {
  // ⚠️ The open driver is CONTROLLED here rather than left to `Disclosure`'s
  // own state, so the hero's token buttons can open one. They are ordinary
  // `#driver-<slug>` links, which means they work as anchors with no JS at all
  // (the row is in the prerendered DOM and the browser scrolls to it); this
  // effect additionally opens the panel once JS is running.
  //
  // Read in an EFFECT, never during render: `location` does not exist during
  // the Node prerender pass, and a server/client disagreement about which row
  // is open would be a hydration mismatch. Initial state is `null` on both.

          navigation.

          ⛔ `light`, NOT `dark`, and this was a real defect on the first cut.
          The hero is `deep`; a `dark` band directly under it is TWO ADJACENT
          DARK-FAMILY SURFACES, which read as one continuous slab with no fold —
          and a cadence check that only compares adjacent TOKENS passes it,
          because `deep` and `dark` are different strings. Exactly the bug
          Clinton reported on /dsc on 02-09-2026. THE HERO CANNOT CHANGE: the
          layout contract requires every page's opening section to be dark,
          because the header is fixed and transparent over it. So the band went
          light. Measured after: darkPair 0.

          ⚠️ EVERY `dark` PROP CAME OFF WITH IT. `SectionHeading`, `Disclosure`
          and `DriverPanel` all take a tone, and the surface system covers
          headings and `var(--surface-*)` accents but NOT the plain `text-ink-*`
          utilities these are built from. Left on `dark` over a light band, the
          body copy would be ink-100 on canvas. */}

 * (FEITIAN) and mToken are distributed under different names by dozens of
 * competing Indian DSC resellers — several of them direct competitors of
 * ThinkOrange's own DSC business — so linking any one of them would be an
 * undisclosed business decision. Same discipline as `fees: null`: defer the
 * unconfirmed thing rather than guess it.
 *
 * So the honest affordance is a link to that token's own row, where the
 * installation steps and troubleshooting actually are, plus one line saying
 * where the file itself comes from. No button says "Download" while doing
 * something else.
 *
 * ⚠️ WRITTEN SO IT UPGRADES ITSELF. The moment a real `url` lands on a
 * driver's Windows entry, that token's button becomes a genuine download with
 * NO change here — `hasFile` flips, the element becomes an `<a download>`, and
 * the caveat line drops away once every driver has one. Whoever sources the
