// /dsc — THE DECISION, AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026, three instructions from Clinton across one day:
//   1. "combine the 5 pages in one" — the five certificate pages merged here.
//   2. "it will only have /dsc route only" — the whole tree collapsed.
//   3. "i want to keep the page minimal… expand the field according to user
//      selection. remove the pan-drive and content. for [token] keep it in
//      another tab like digital signature."
//   4. "protal guide and document has to be dsc page… i do not need
//      'certificate[s] we issue' also, change 'how it work[s]' in[to] 'after
//      you get' section, change the bottom cta also according to dsc."
//
// (3) is why this file is short. The version between (2) and (3) had thirteen
// sections and every checklist, driver and FAQ laid out flat — technically a
// merge, but a wall. This page now carries only what a visitor came to decide:
// which certificate they need, what the five are, how issuance works, and the
// partner programme. Everything technical is one tab away at
// `/dsc/resources` — exactly the split ThinkOrange_DSC_Resources_V1.html
// argues for in its own copy ("keep the detailed technical information here,
// away from the main DSC sales page").
//
// ⚠️ THE USB TOKEN OFFER IS DELETED, not moved. `content/dsc/products.js` is
// gone. What survives is every certificate's statement that it is issued ON a
// token — that is how a Class 3 certificate works, and dropping it would leave
// this page wrong about what a buyer receives.
//
// ⛔ THERE IS NO "CERTIFICATES WE ISSUE" SECTION (instruction 4). The five
// certificates are still fully described — by the finder, which names one and
// shows its documents, validity and caveats — but listing all five again
// underneath it was the same content twice on one page. `certificateVariants`
// is still the source the finder and the document checklists resolve against;
// only the redundant list is gone.
//
// ⚠️ EXPANSION IS THE POINT, not decoration. The document checklists render
// collapsed and open one at a time — laying five of them out flat is what made
// the earlier version dense.
//
// ⚠️ SURFACE CADENCE: deep → light → light-alt → dark → light → light-alt →
// ember. Zero consecutive repeats AND no two adjacent dark-family surfaces —
// the second property is the one that actually matters visually, and the one a
// naive token-comparison check misses (see the finder section below). Verify
// off `section[data-surface]` in the live DOM; the footer is `deep`, so a bare
// `[data-surface]` selector misreads the end.

              - `gradientId` MUST be unique per mounted instance. `url(#id)`
                resolves DOCUMENT-wide, not per-<svg>, so a duplicate would
                silently light from whichever <defs> mounted last.
              - `zIndex: -1`, NOT `.arc-rings`' own `z-index: 0`. A positioned
                z-0 layer paints at step 6 of the painting order and in-flow
                TEXT paints at step 5 — i.e. it would sit ON TOP of the
                finder's copy. At -1 it paints above the section background and
                below everything else, with nothing for the content to
                remember. The section already carries `isolate` (Section adds
                it whenever a texture is set), so the negative index stays
                contained.
                ⚠️ It is an INLINE STYLE, not a `z-[-1]` class, and that is not
                laziness: `.arc-rings` is UNLAYERED CSS in theme.css, so it
                beats Tailwind's `@layer utilities` and the class silently lost
                — measured `zIndex: "0"` with the class applied. Same
                specificity trap as `.field-bare`'s focus ring.
                ⚠️ `pointer-events: none` on `.arc-rings` means an
                `elementFromPoint` check CANNOT detect this — it passes through
                the overlay and reports the text as hittable either way. Read
                the computed `zIndex`, or look at a screenshot.

          these sections is a render-only change. Do NOT prune them as dead
          content on a later tidy-up pass.

          ⚠️ CONSEQUENCE WORTH KNOWING: the document checklists are now
          reachable ONLY through the finder, which renders on demand in JS.
          This file's own note above — and CLAUDE.md's — recorded that
          on-demand results were safe precisely BECAUSE this page carried every
          checklist as ordinary visible content. That is no longer true, so a
