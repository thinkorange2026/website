      {/* ⛔ THIS SECTION OPENS LIGHT, WHICH BREAKS HALF OF CLAUDE.md's LAYOUT
          CONTRACT ON PURPOSE (Clinton, 20-08-2026: "in the article page do not
          make the hero section dark colour make it light colour").

          That contract requires every page's opening section to be dark, because
          the header is fixed and transparent over it and renders
          canvas-coloured text. Its own stated remedy for a template that must
          open light is "the header needs a per-route solid variant — not a local
          hack", so that is what was built: nav.js marks these routes `lightTop`
          and Header.jsx renders the solid/glass state it already owns from
          scroll position 0. Nothing is hacked locally here, and the other ~40
          heroes are untouched.

          It is also deliberately NOT `PageHero`. That primitive is the shared
          compact DARK hero for T2/T3/T4/T5 — `data-surface="deep"`,
          `text-canvas` h1, ink-300 lede — and adding a light mode to it would
          put a second surface family into a component 40+ routes depend on. An
          editorial header is a different archetype: headline, then the excerpt
          and the meta on one baseline, a rule, and the photograph.

          ONE section carries the header, the rule, the photo AND the body.
          Splitting the header out would put two `light` sections back to back,
          which reads as one surface anyway and registers as a consecutive
          repeat in the surface-cadence audit (it counts `section[data-surface]`).
          `page-top` supplies the fixed header's clearance; the bottom padding
          matches `.section-pad`'s own clamp so the page ends like every other. */}

                content type on an adjacent page. Three things were wrong with
                the previous version and all three are why the row looked
                unfinished:

                  1. No thumbnail, while the index cards and the homepage list
                     both carry one — so the same article looked like a
                     different kind of thing depending on where you met it.
                  2. `h-full` alone stretches the CARD but not its contents, so
                     with three different excerpt lengths nothing lined up: the
                     row had no common floor. `flex h-full flex-col` plus
                     `mt-auto` on the action row pins "Read the article" to the
                     bottom of every card regardless of excerpt length. Rows
                     landing at different heights across a grid is exactly the
                     detail recorded in CLAUDE.md as making a set "look
                     untended".
                  3. No read time and no action affordance, so a card that IS a
                     link gave no sign of being one beyond the hover state.

                `alt=""` because the headline immediately below is the same
                information; a description of the photo would only dilute it
                (WCAG 1.1.1). Same call as the index cards. */}
