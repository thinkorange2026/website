// ============================================================================
// STATUTORY FACTS — single source of truth for every number, form and deadline
// this site asserts about Indian tax law.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// Service-page prose is full of claims like "₹40 lakh" and "7 working days".
// If those live inline in 21 separate leaf files, three things go wrong:
//   1. The Finance Act changes one and you have to find every mention.
//   2. The CA reviewing the site has to read 21 pages of prose to audit them.
//   3. Prose and the review checklist drift apart silently.
// So every such fact is defined ONCE here, with its legal basis and source,
// and leaf files interpolate it. `npm run content:review` turns this file into
// a sign-off checklist (scripts/content-review.mjs).
//
// HARD RULE: no statutory number, form code, deadline or penalty may be typed
// directly into a leaf file. If it is not in here, add it here first.
//
// ⚠️  EVERY VALUE BELOW NEEDS PROFESSIONAL SIGN-OFF BEFORE THE SITE GOES LIVE.
// These were researched from public sources on the date in `asOf`, not taken
// from an AI model's training data — but they are still not a substitute for a
// practising CA confirming them against the current Act, Rules and
// notifications. Indian tax law changes with every Finance Act.

  //      Act and say so (BLOCKERS.md §1 Option A).
