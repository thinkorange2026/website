// --- Service categories (T3 hubs) and their leaves (T2) --------------------
// `group` drives the mega panel's hairline separation: statutory columns
// first, then the growth column(s) set apart (DESIGN.md §10.2, CONTENT-PLAN.md
// §3.1). The mechanism doesn't assume a fixed split — MegaPanel.jsx sorts by
// `group` and finds the first "growth" index at render time — so it tolerates
// 5 statutory + 1 growth below exactly as it did 4 + 2 before.
//
// ⚠️ 17-08-2026: restructured against the client's revised services mega-menu
// (thinkorange-services-menu.html, content only — the menu's own visual mockup
// was NOT implemented, this file carries IA/labels only). Changes from the
// previous structure, kept here rather than only in git history because a few
// are non-obvious:
//   - New category: Registrations & Licences. `msme-udyam` and
//     `startup-india-dpiit` MOVED here from Business Setup (their content
//     files are unchanged — only their nav.js parent/path moved). Four new,
//     unwritten leaves added. See MISSING-PAGES.md.
//   - Business Setup gained one new, unwritten leaf (Trust, Society &
//     Section 8) and lost the two leaves above.
//   - Accounting & Audit relabelled "Accounting, Payroll & Audit" — slug and
//     path are UNCHANGED (still `accounting-audit`) so the three written
//     leaves under it keep their existing URLs. Three new, unwritten leaves
//     added.
//   - Government Tenders + Loans & Finance MERGED into one category, Tenders
//     & Finance (`tenders-finance`). All four leaves under it were previously
//     written and are unchanged in content — only their nav.js parent/path
//     moved. `category-content.js`'s two old hub entries were combined into
//     one under the new slug (existing approved prose recombined, nothing
//     new written); WhatWeDo.jsx's PROMISES/SPANS maps were updated to match.
//   - GST gained one new, unwritten leaf (LUT & Export Refunds).
//   - Income Tax gained one new, unwritten leaf (Notices & Assessments) —
//     ⛔ blocked the same way as the category's other three leaves, see
//     BLOCKERS.md §1.
// None of the moved leaves needed a content-file edit beyond their own
// `category` field (cosmetic metadata, not read at render time — see
// _schema.js — but kept accurate).

// --- DSC: ONE PAGE ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026 (Clinton, two instructions the same day):
//   1. "for the dsc i do not need multiple page like class 3 - individual,
//      class -3 organisation, like that so combine the 5 pages in one."
//   2. "keep dsc and resources as a single tab like home… so now it will only
//      have /dsc route only."
//
// THE ENTIRE DSC TREE IS NOW ONE ROUTE. Eleven pages became sections of /dsc:
// five certificate pages, the token page, Documents Required, Validity &
// Renewal, the drivers hub and its four driver pages. `dscProducts`,
// `dscPanelColumns`, `dscDocumentsPage`, `dscValidityFaqsPage` and
// `dscDriversHub` are GONE as exports — every one of them existed to describe
// a route, and there is one route left.
//
// Content was MOVED, not rewritten. It lives in content/dsc/ exactly as it
// did (certificates.js, drivers.js, products.js, validity-renewal-faqs.js)
// and `DscHub.jsx` renders it as sections. Structure and framing follow the
// two reference documents Clinton supplied (ThinkOrange_DSC_Hub_V7.html and
// _V4.html), both of which set their canonical to /dsc and are written as one
// landing page rather than a hub over children.
//
// ⚠️ Templates T4 (DSC product) and T5 (DSC utility) no longer have any route
// pointing at them and their modules are deleted. Do not reintroduce a
// template branch for either without a route to justify it.

// The section anchors of /dsc. Declared here, once, because three surfaces
// have to agree on them: the mega-panel-free nav link's deep links, the hub's
// own <Section id>s and its sticky sub-nav. A tab, a link and a section that
// disagree by one character scroll nowhere and light up never.

  // is a fragment that names nothing — which is how `/dsc#certificates` shipped
  // dead twice. Everything that pointed at `documents` now points at `finder`,
  // which is what actually produces a checklist today.
  // ⛔ 03-09-2026: `certificates` is GONE. The "certificates we issue" section
  // was deleted from /dsc on 02-09-2026 ("i do not need certificate we issue
  // also") — but this key survived it, so five redirect stubs and the homepage
  // DSC band were all pointing at `/dsc#certificates`, a fragment that names
  // nothing. Nothing errors and the link-integrity scan passes it, because the
  // PATH is real and only the FRAGMENT is dead. Exactly the `/dsc#undefined`
  // failure mode again, one step subtler. Everything that named it now names
  // `finder`, which is what actually answers "which certificate do I need" and
  // renders each one's validity, documents and caveats.
  // ⚠️ Deleting a section from a template means deleting its id here too, and
  // grepping for the key. The two cannot be done separately.
  // ⛔ 05-09-2026 (Clinton): "shift the notice board section of dsc page to
  // dsc faq page." `notices` MOVED to `dscFaqSectionIds` below rather than
  // being duplicated — an id that lives in the wrong object silently produces

  // records twice. /dsc no longer has a notices section, so it no longer has
  // the id.

// resouce page i ha[ve] to mainly focus on token and driver, the[ir] validity

 *     accurate label and points at the page that now covers it.
 *  3. `hash` sends a reader to the section that absorbed the page, rather than
 *     dropping them at the top of a long page to hunt for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `label` must stay in step with content/dsc/certificates.js and
 * content/dsc/drivers.js. It is not imported from either because this file
 * sits at the top of the content graph and is loaded by the Node scripts; it
