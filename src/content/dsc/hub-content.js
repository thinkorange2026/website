    "Class 3 Digital Signature Certificates for individuals and organisations, combo certificates for e-tendering, DGFT certificates for importers and exporters, and renewals — issued through a licensed Certifying Authority, from our Salem, Tamil Nadu office to clients across India.",
  intro: [
    "A Digital Signature Certificate is what lets you sign legally on the income tax portal, the GST portal, MCA21, e-tendering platforms, EPFO and DGFT/ICEGATE — anywhere a physical signature isn't possible. Getting the wrong class, the wrong validity, or a certificate from an improperly authorised issuer causes more lost time than almost anything else in this line of work.",
    // ⛔ eSign PAUSED — 21-08-2026. Original had, after "running out.":
    // "Aadhaar eSign is below that, for contracts that don't need a certificate
    // at all, followed by tokens, document checklists and driver downloads — or
    // start from Documents Required…".
    "We issue every certificate through a licensed Certifying Authority, so genuineness is never a question mark. Answer two questions in the finder and it names the certificate you need. Document checklists, the portal-by-portal guide, token drivers and renewal all live in DSC Resources, so this page stays about the decision.",
  ],
  // 20-08-2026 — the hero panel's list. NOT new content: these are exactly
  // the portals already named in `intro[0]` above, as a list instead of
  // prose, so the premium hero can show them above the fold. Kept in THIS
  // file, adjacent to the paragraph they come from, so the two cannot quietly
  // disagree — if a portal is added or removed, change both. The footnote is
  // the same assertion the "Can Aadhaar eSign replace a DSC?" FAQ below makes,
  // and the same one `aadhaar-esign`'s own verificationNote and the
  // eSign-or-DSC comparison table make: it is the single most important
  // correction in the DSC tree, so it is stated wherever a reader might stop.

  // ⛔ 02-09-2026: this hub's own five-FAQ list is GONE, replaced by

  // a second list here would have put two overlapping FAQ sets on one page,
  // which is exactly the duplication the merge exists to remove.

    "Issued through a licensed Certifying Authority — not a reseller of unknown standing.",

// ⛔ 02-09-2026: `dscDocumentsMeta` is gone with /dsc/documents-required
// itself. That page is now the `#documents` section of /dsc, which is covered
// by `meta` above; a separate meta object with no page to attach to is a trap
// for whoever reads this next.

// ⛔ 02-09-2026: `dscResourcesMeta` is gone — that page became the Buy Token
// page and its meta now lives with the product it describes, in
// content/dsc/token.js.
