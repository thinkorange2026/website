// DSC CERTIFICATE CONTENT — the single source for what used to be five
// separate T4 product pages.
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026 (Clinton): "for the dsc i do not need multiple page like
// class 3 - individual, class -3 organisation, like that so combine the 5
// pages in one." The five certificate routes — /dsc/class-3-individual,
// /dsc/class-3-organisation, /dsc/combo-dsc, /dsc/dgft-iec and
// /dsc/renewal-reissue — are GONE. Their content lives here and renders on
// /dsc itself. Structure and framing follow the two reference documents
// Clinton supplied (ThinkOrange_DSC_Hub_V7.html, ThinkOrange_DSC_Hub_V4.html),
// both of which set their canonical to /dsc and are written as one landing
// page rather than a hub over five children. The DESIGN of that page follows
// this site, not either mockup — neither was implemented visually.
//
// Every sentence below is either carried over verbatim from the five product
// files it replaces (already reviewed) or taken from the reference documents.
// The same disciplines apply as everywhere else in this repo:
//   - No fee, no rupee amount, no turnaround guarantee. The reference files
//     carry literal "₹[X]" / "[X hrs]" placeholders; those are placeholders,
//     not facts, and none of them were typed in. Pricing is "On request"
//     (fees: null discipline); timing comes from turnaround.js.
//   - No statutory citation that has not been researched. V7's "Class 2 was
//     discontinued by the CCA in January 2021" is a dated regulatory fact and
//     would need statutory.js with a source, so it is NOT asserted here — the
//     Class 2 FAQ states the practical position instead. Recorded in
//     MISSING-PAGES.md as a research item.
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026, later the same day: THE USB TOKEN OFFER IS DELETED, on
// Clinton's instruction ("remove the pan-drive and content"). What used to be
// `content/dsc/products.js` — the "Buy DSC Tokens" product, its own document
// list, process and FAQs — is gone from the site entirely, not relocated. Its
// copy is recoverable from git history if it is ever wanted back.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT DELIBERATELY SURVIVES: every certificate's `tokenNote`, and the
// sentences saying a Class 3 certificate is issued on a FIPS 140-3 compliant USB
// token and cannot be held as a file. That is not the token product — it is
// how a Class 3 certificate works, and stripping it would leave the
// certificates section quietly wrong about what a buyer receives.
//
// ⚠️ `key` is what the finder, the icon map and the documents page all join
// on. They are the OLD route slugs, deliberately: six service leaves still
// carry them in `related`, the icon map is keyed by them, and keeping them
// means the retired URLs, the redirects and this content all agree on one
// identifier per certificate.

/**
 * THE TWO VERIFICATION ROUTES, and why the document list depends on which one
 * you are on.
 *
 * ⛔ 03-09-2026 — from Clinton's `dsc-finder-preview.html`, which is the first
 * thing on this site to model it. Every checklist here used to assume the
 * Aadhaar route and simply listed "Aadhaar card" and "Passport-sized
 * photograph" side by side, which is wrong in both directions: on the Aadhaar
 * route the record supplies the photograph and the address, so neither is sent
 * separately; on the PAN route there is no Aadhaar record at all, so both have
 * to be.
 *
 * ⚠️ These extras are inserted BEFORE the final line of a `documentCore`,
 * because that line is always the video-verification contact detail and it
 * reads as the last thing you do. Keep it last in every core list.
 */
// ⛔ ONE STRING, REFERENCED TWICE. Both routes ask for an email address
// (11-09-2026, below), and two literals 20 lines apart is how one of them gets
// reworded and the other quietly keeps the old phrasing — which is the exact
// failure the 07-09-2026 pass had to clean up when the same fact was stated in
// two different wordings on one checklist.
//
// ⚠️ `isContactDetail` matches it, so it renders in the list but is NOT counted
// as a document. Reword it and check that predicate still matches, or every
// PAN and Aadhaar checklist silently gains one from its count.

  {
    q: "Which certificate do I need — Individual or Organisation?",
    a: "Individual, if you are signing in your own personal capacity: income tax filing, trademark filing, or acting as a director on MCA where directors sign as officers rather than on behalf of the entity. Organisation, if you are signing on behalf of a company or LLP — ROC filings by an authorised signatory, corporate tender bidding, company GST or EPFO submissions. If you are not sure which applies to you, use the finder above or message us before you order.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a director. Do I need an Organisation certificate for MCA filings?",
    a: "Usually not. Directors sign MCA forms in their personal capacity as officers of the company, so a Class 3 Individual certificate in your own name is normally sufficient — and it costs less. One thing to check: the PAN on your certificate must match the PAN in your DIN record, including how your name is spelled. Mismatches there are the most common reason association fails on the portal.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which certificate do I need for GeM and government tenders?",
    a: "A Class 3 Combo, which carries both signing and encryption. Most procurement portals require bids to be signed and encrypted before submission. Encryption cannot be added to a signing certificate afterwards, so buying signature-only and discovering the requirement on the closing day means losing the tender rather than delaying it. Send us the tender document and we will confirm what it asks for before you order.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a dedicated DGFT certificate?",
    a: "Not necessarily, and this is where exporters most often overspend. The DGFT portal validates against your IEC profile. For a proprietorship, a Class 3 Individual or Organisation certificate works where it matches the PAN in that profile. For companies and LLPs, a Class 3 Organisation certificate works where the organisation name matches the PAN database name. A dedicated DGFT token with the IEC embedded is a third option, useful in some cases but not compulsory. Whichever you use has to be registered against your IEC on the DGFT portal before it is recognised there.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can one certificate be used on more than one portal?",
    a: "Yes, and most people should. A single Class 3 Individual certificate covers income tax, GST, MCA and trademark filings. You would need a separate Organisation certificate only where you sign on behalf of an entity, and a Combo only where a portal requires encryption. Tell us everything you file on and we will work out the smallest number of certificates that covers it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the video verification step, and can it be skipped?",
    a: "It is a short recorded call confirming your identity against your submitted documents, required by the Controller of Certifying Authorities for all Class 3 issuance. It applies to every certificate type — individual, organisation, combo, DGFT and renewals alike — and it cannot be skipped. It takes a few minutes on your own phone and has to happen before the certificate is generated, not after.",
  },
  {
    q: "Whose name does an organisation certificate carry — the company's or the signatory's?",
    a: "Both. It is issued to the organisation but carries the named signatory as the certificate holder, since a digital signature is legally tied to an individual acting in an authorised capacity, not to an entity in the abstract. If your authorised signatory changes, the existing certificate stays valid for the original signatory until it expires, but a new one is needed for the new signatory — they are not transferable between people.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I actually \"renew\" a certificate, or is it always a new one?",
    a: "It is always a fresh certificate — Indian certifying authorities do not extend an existing one's expiry. \"Renewal\" describes doing this before your current certificate lapses, which usually lets you reuse a working token and moves faster since less has changed since your last verification. Renewing also resets the validity period rather than adding to what was left.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a USB token?",
    a: "Yes. A Class 3 certificate must be stored on a compliant USB crypto token and cannot be held as a file on a computer. The token itself does not expire and can usually be reused when the certificate is renewed. If you already have one, send us the model and we will confirm whether it can be reused.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a foreign national get an Indian DSC without Aadhaar?",
    a: "Yes. Foreign applicants use a passport-based route with attested supporting documents rather than Aadhaar. The whole process can be completed from outside India and the token couriered internationally. The attestation route depends on your country — apostille where it is party to the Hague Convention, otherwise attestation by the Indian Embassy or Consulate — so confirm which applies before preparing anything, because getting it wrong means doing it twice.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Class 3 certificate the same everywhere, or does the issuer matter?",
    a: "The certificate follows the same standard regardless of issuer, but genuineness and the support you get afterwards depend entirely on going through a properly authorised certifying authority. We issue through a licensed Certifying Authority rather than reselling from an issuer of unknown standing. Class 3 is also the only class still issued — if you are being offered a choice of class, that tells you something about how closely the vendor follows this business.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to visit your office?",
    a: "No. Everything is done online, including the verification, which takes a few minutes on your own phone. The token is couriered to you. We work with clients across India and outside it.",
