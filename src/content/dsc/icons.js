// One icon per DSC page. 20-08-2026, Clinton: "include icon, images make it
// clean and look premium still most of section is look too plain."
//
// This map used to live privately inside `home/sections/DscBand.jsx`, which
// meant the /dsc hub had no icons at all and adding them would have forked the
// pairing — the homepage showing a key for "Buy DSC Tokens" while the hub
// showed something else. One map, consumed by both.
//
// ⚠️ NOTE THIS IS A COMPONENT-SIDE MODULE despite living under `src/content/`:
// it imports React components from lucide. Never import it from `nav.js`,
// `seo.js`, or anything `scripts/prerender.mjs` / `scripts/content-check.mjs`
// load directly under plain Node. Same caveat as
// `src/content/insights/images.js`, which holds Vite imagetools imports for
// the same kind of reason.
//
// ⛔ ALWAYS resolve through `dscIcon()`, never by indexing this object.
// `DscBand` iterates every product in nav.js and renders `<Icon />`; a slug
// with no entry evaluates to `<undefined />`, which is a HARD React crash
// ("invalid element type"), not a graceful blank. That was a real bug caught
// before shipping when the 17-08-2026 menu restructure added three products.
// The fallback below makes the whole class of bug impossible.
