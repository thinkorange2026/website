// DSC FINDER — the wizard that replaces five certificate pages.
//
// ⛔ REBUILT 03-09-2026 against Clinton's `dsc-finder-preview.html`, which is
// the third and most decisive revision of this idea. Two things changed, and
// the first is the important one:
//
//  1. **Question one asks WHAT FOR, not WHICH PORTAL.** It used to list ten
//     portals; it now lists three purposes plus the foreign-national route,
//     as four peer cards (see the ⛔ note on that entry).
//     That is not a simplification for its own sake — it is the reference's
//     actual finding: the statutory portals (GST, income tax, MCA and ROC,
//     EPFO and ESIC, trademark) all take the SAME certificate, so asking which
//     of them you are on was a question whose answer never changed anything.
//  2. **Question two asks WHO SIGNS, with three answers, not two.**
//     Partnership/trust is now its own route because its answer differs from a
//     company's in whose name goes on the certificate.
//
// ⛔⛔ **UNRESOLVED CONTENT CONFLICT — READ BEFORE PUBLISHING ANOTHER WORD OF
// DSC COPY.** `filings|any` below states, in the reference's own wording, that
// ONE Class 3 Individual certificate covers GST, income tax, MCA/ROC, EPFO/ESIC
// and trademark "whether you are a proprietor, a company or an LLP", with no
// organisation documents needed. `portalGuide` in certificates.js — rendered
// further down the SAME page — says the opposite in two rows: GST needs an
// Organisation certificate for companies and LLPs, and for EPFO "a personal
// certificate will not work". Both cannot be true, and the page currently
// asserts both. The reference is newer and is Clinton's own, so it is what is
// implemented here; `portalGuide` was left untouched because correcting it is a
// factual call, not a formatting one. Logged in MISSING-PAGES.md.
//
// ⚠️ RESULTS SELECT BY REFERENCE. An answer names a `certificate` key and the
// component resolves the validity options, the verification note and the
// document checklist out of `certificates.js` at render time. Copying a
// checklist in here would fork it, and a correction to a certificate would
// leave the finder confidently showing the superseded version. What an answer
// owns is only what is specific to THAT route: whose name, what it covers, and
// the one thing that goes wrong.
//
// ⚠️ No fee, no timeline, no turnaround promise appears in any answer. The
// reference's own result cards carry "₹[X]" and "[X hrs]"; those are
// placeholders in the source, not facts, and none were carried over.

/**
 * Question one. `pill` is the certificate this route leads to, shown up front.
 *
 * ⚠️ `label` IS ALSO THE CROSS-LINK LABEL on the result (07-09-2026). A first
 * cut gave each entry its own `crossLabel` phrased as a question ("Bidding on a
 * tender instead?"); Clinton: "write as direct name as write in card otherwise
 * it looks confuse." One name per route, used on the card and on the switch, so
 * a reader recognises the destination as the card they already saw — and there
 * is no second string to drift. The row's own "Not what you were after?" label
 * carries the framing instead.
