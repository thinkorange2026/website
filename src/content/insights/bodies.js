// Nothing here touches income tax computation, ITR, TDS or assessments —
// BLOCKERS.md §1 (Income Tax Act 2025 renumbering) is unreviewed, so those
// remain out of scope for editorial as much as for the four blocked leaves.
// Where a reader would reasonably ask an income-tax question, the article says
// to ask us rather than answering it.
//
// Shape: { lede, sections: [{ heading, paragraphs?, bullets?, note? }], closing }
// — deliberately plain data, no markdown parser. The template renders each
// section in a FIXED order: paragraphs, then bullets, then `note` paragraphs
// after the list. `note` exists precisely so a section can close with prose
// after its list without the order depending on key order in this object.
// Anything richer than that is a signal the article wants to be a service page.
