// INSIGHTS INDEX (T10) — CONTENT-PLAN.md §6 row 12's own bar: "Omit from v1.
// An empty or thin blog is worse than no blog. Reserve the route and add at 4+
// articles." Four real articles now exist, so the section is live.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS THE INDEX ONLY — no article prose lives here, and that split
// is load-bearing, not tidiness. `nav.js` imports this module to build the
// /insights routes, and nav.js is in the always-eager main chunk; article
// bodies therefore live in ./bodies.js, which only the article template (its
// own lazy route chunk) imports. Put a body back in here and every page on the
// site downloads all four articles before its own first paint — the same class
// of regression Phase 7 and Phase 9 both had to undo.
//
// Content discipline is identical to a service leaf (see CLAUDE.md):
//   - No fee, no turnaround promise, no client count, no invented statistic.
//   - Every statutory value comes through `s()` from statutory.js, so a CA
//     correction there propagates into the articles automatically. Nothing
//     statutory is typed as a literal in ./bodies.js.
//   - Nothing sourced from income-tax territory: the Income Tax Act 2025
//     renumbering (BLOCKERS.md §1) is unreviewed here as much as it is in the
//     four blocked service leaves, so no article touches it.
//
// `confirmed: true` means "this points at a real, published article on a route
// that exists" — the flag Insights.jsx and content-check.mjs both read. It is
// NOT a claim that a CA has reviewed the prose; that's what `review` is for on
// a service leaf, and these four carry the same statutory keys their source
// leaves already carry into CONTENT-REVIEW.md.

/** Published date for all four — the day they were written. Not backdated to
 *  imply a longer-running editorial than exists. */

  //   1. `insights` dropped to 3, below `MIN_ARTICLES_TO_SHOW` (4), so the

  //      writing a fourth non-eSign article (annual-roc-filings-companies-llps)
  //      rather than lowering the threshold: the section is a feature-plus-three
  //      layout, and 3 would render a feature plus TWO, which is the thin
  //      editorial row that threshold exists to prevent.
  //   2. An article page's "More insights" row offers the other three.
