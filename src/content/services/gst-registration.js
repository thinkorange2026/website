// Three things to copy, beyond the field shape:
//   1. VOICE (§16). Second person, active, present tense. Lead with the
//      reader's problem, not the firm's capability. Explain every acronym on
//      first use — the reader is a business owner, not a practitioner.
//   2. NO INVENTED FACTS. Every statutory number comes from statutory.js via
//      s(). Nothing numeric is typed inline. `fees` is null.
//   3. DOCUMENTS IS THE MOST VALUABLE SECTION (§7). It is what people search
//      for and what earns links. Make it exact, grouped, and printable — not
//      a vague summary.

  overview: [
    `Goods and Services Tax (GST) registration gives your business a GSTIN, a ${s("gstinLength")} identifier tied to your PAN and your state. Once you hold one you can charge GST on your invoices, claim input tax credit on your purchases, and trade with the many businesses that will not deal with an unregistered supplier.`,

    `Above certain limits it is not optional. If your aggregate turnover crosses ${s("gstThresholdGoods")} for goods or ${s("gstThresholdServices")} for services in a financial year, you must register — and turnover is counted across India on a single PAN, not state by state. Several situations require registration whatever your turnover: supplying to a customer in another state, selling through an e-commerce platform, or operating as a casual taxable person at an exhibition or seasonal site.`,

    `Trading unregistered when you were liable is expensive. Under Section 122 of the CGST Act the penalty is ${s("gstNonRegistrationPenalty")}, and you still owe the tax you should have collected across the whole unregistered period, plus interest. Most cases we see are not deliberate — a business crossed the threshold mid-year and nobody was watching the number.`,

    {
      q: "How long does GST registration take?",

Small businesses eligible for the Rule 14A simplified scheme can be approved in ${s("gstRule14ADays")}. Without Aadhaar authentication, or where the officer orders physical verification of your premises, allow ${s("gstRegNoAadhaarDays")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the turnover threshold in Tamil Nadu?",
      a: `Tamil Nadu is a normal category state, so the thresholds are ${s("gstThresholdGoods")} of aggregate turnover for goods and ${s("gstThresholdServices")} for services. The lower special-category figures do not apply here. Aggregate turnover is measured across India on one PAN, so branches in other states count towards the same limit.`,
    },
    {
      q: "By when must I apply after crossing the threshold?",
      a: `Within ${s("gstRegApplyWindow")} of becoming liable, under Section 25(1). The timing matters beyond the deadline itself: apply inside the window and your registration is effective from the date liability arose, so the period is clean. Apply late and it takes effect only from the date of grant, leaving the gap exposed.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if my application is rejected?",
      a: `Rejection almost always follows an unanswered ${s("gstFormQuery")} notice or a mismatch between your documents and the application — an address proof that does not match the premises, or a signatory who is not authorised. You can reapply. We would rather fix the cause first, because a second rejection on the same ground draws closer scrutiny.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a separate registration for each state?",
      a: "Yes. GST is state-specific, so you register separately in every state or union territory from which you make taxable supplies, even under one PAN and one business name. A single registration does not cover a branch, warehouse or site in another state.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I register voluntarily if I am below the threshold?",
      a: "Yes, and it is often worth it. Voluntary registration lets you claim input tax credit on purchases and makes you a viable supplier to registered businesses that need the credit. The trade-off is real, though: once registered you carry the full return-filing obligation whatever your turnover.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I trade without registering when I was liable?",
      a: `The penalty under Section 122 is ${s("gstNonRegistrationPenalty")}. On top of that you owe the tax you should have collected for the entire unregistered period, plus interest, and you cannot claim input credit for that period. Wilful evasion is treated far more harshly than a missed threshold.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a Digital Signature Certificate?",
      a: "Companies and LLPs do — a Class 3 DSC is mandatory, as they cannot sign with Aadhaar OTP. Proprietorships and partnership firms can normally authenticate with Aadhaar OTP instead. We issue Class 3 certificates ourselves, so this does not have to become a separate errand.",
