// Follows the pattern in gst-registration.js.
//
// Angle: the internet is full of the OLD OPC rules. The ₹50 lakh / ₹2 crore
// mandatory conversion thresholds were removed in 2021, and the residency test
// dropped from 182 to 120 days. Competitors' pages still state the old figures.
// Getting this right is a genuine differentiator, so say so plainly.

  overview: [
    `A One Person Company gives a solo founder what a proprietorship cannot: a separate legal entity and limited liability, without having to find a second shareholder. It needs ${s("opcStructure")}. The nominee is the distinctive requirement — a person you name who takes over membership if you die or become incapacitated, which is also the feature that makes an OPC more robust than a proprietorship.`,

    `Two rules changed in 2021 and much of what is published online is still out of date. First, conversion: ${s("opcMandatoryConversion").toLowerCase()}. The ceilings of ${s("opcRepealedConversionThresholds")} that once forced an OPC to become a private limited company were removed, so an OPC can now operate at any scale indefinitely and convert voluntarily whenever it suits. Second, residency: the test is now ${s("opcResidency")}, reduced from 182 days, and non-resident Indian citizens may incorporate an OPC.`,

    `The honest trade-off is compliance. An OPC is a company, so it carries audited accounts, an appointed auditor and annual ROC filings — considerably more than a proprietorship. Choose it when limited liability or corporate standing genuinely matters to you, not to look more established than you are.`,
  ],

  whoNeedsThis: [
    "You are a single founder who wants limited liability, so business risk does not reach your personal assets.",
    "You want a corporate identity and a CIN, because clients or platforms will not contract with a proprietorship.",
    "You have outgrown a proprietorship but have no second shareholder to bring in.",
    "You want the business to survive you — the nominee structure means it does not simply end.",
    `You are an Indian citizen meeting the ${s("opcResidency")} residency test, or a non-resident Indian citizen.`,
    "You expect to convert to a private limited company later and want to start with corporate structure in place.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Is there a turnover limit above which an OPC must convert?",
      a: `No. ${s("opcMandatoryConversion")}. The ceilings of ${s("opcRepealedConversionThresholds")} were removed by the Companies (Incorporation) Second Amendment Rules 2021. Many websites still state them. An OPC can operate at any scale indefinitely and convert voluntarily whenever it chooses.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Who can incorporate an OPC?",
      a: `A natural person who is an Indian citizen. The residency test is ${s("opcResidency")}, reduced from 182 days in 2021, and non-resident Indian citizens may now incorporate one too. One person can hold only one OPC at a time.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Why does an OPC need a nominee?",
      a: "Because a company must be able to continue when its only member cannot. The nominee steps into membership on your death or incapacity, which is precisely what a proprietorship cannot do. They must be an Indian citizen and resident, must consent in writing, and can be changed later.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is an OPC different from a proprietorship?",
      a: "An OPC is a separate legal entity with limited liability; a proprietorship is legally you. That protection is the main reason to choose an OPC. The cost is compliance — audited accounts, an auditor and annual ROC filings, none of which a proprietorship carries.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I start with an OPC or a private limited company?",
      a: "An OPC if you genuinely have no second shareholder and want to start now. A private limited company if you have or expect a co-founder or investor, since investors cannot hold shares in an OPC. Converting later is straightforward, so starting as an OPC is not a trap.",
    },
    {
      q: "What annual compliance does an OPC carry?",
      a: `Audited accounts, an appointed auditor, AOC-4 within ${s("aoc4Window")} and an annual return. Lighter than a private limited company in some respects — an OPC is exempt from holding an annual general meeting — but far heavier than a proprietorship. Budget for it before incorporating.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can I convert my OPC to a private limited company later?",
      a: "Yes, voluntarily and at any time — there is no waiting period and no turnover threshold to reach first. You will need to bring in at least one more shareholder and a second director, and the conversion is filed with the Registrar.",

If any of these have moved back, the page's angle collapses.",
