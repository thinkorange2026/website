// Follows the pattern in gst-registration.js and private-limited-company.js.
//
// Reuses private-limited-company.js's already-cited ROC keys wherever the
// same fact applies (aoc4Window, mgt7Window, inc20aWindow, llpForm8Due,
// llpForm11Due, llpLateFee, booksRetentionCompanies) rather than re-deriving
// them — this leaf is about the RECURRING annual filings, so it deliberately
// contrasts them against INC-20A's one-time window rather than repeating
// private-limited-company.js's incorporation-stage content.
//
// AOC-4's late-filing penalty amount is deliberately NOT stated here either,
// matching private-limited-company.js's own review note: research returned
// conflicting figures and that page already flags it as unconfirmed.

Every director also needs DIR-3 KYC filed by ${s("dir3KycDeadline")}, or the DIN is marked inactive until cleared with a ${s("dir3KycLateFee")}.`,

      q: "What is the difference between AOC-4 and MGT-7?",
      a: `AOC-4 files your financial statements, within ${s("aoc4Window")}. MGT-7 (or the abridged MGT-7A) files your annual return — directors, shareholding and registers — within ${s("mgt7Window")}. Both are separate filings against the same AGM, and both are mandatory every year, regardless of activity.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Who can file MGT-7A instead of MGT-7?",
      a: `${s("mgt7aApplicability")} A company currently counts as small if it has ${s("smallCompanyThreshold")}, so most very small private companies qualify — but the classification is checked every year against that year's figures, not fixed at incorporation.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is DIR-3 KYC and why does it matter?",
      a: `It is the annual identity confirmation every director holding a DIN must file, due by ${s("dir3KycDeadline")}. Miss it and the DIN is marked inactive, which blocks that person from signing any MCA filing until it is cleared with a ${s("dir3KycLateFee")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do dormant companies and LLPs still need to file?",
      a: "Yes. A company or LLP with no transactions in the year still owes AOC-4, MGT-7 or MGT-7A, and DIR-3 KYC — or Forms 8 and 11 for an LLP. Dormant status under the Companies Act is a separate, formal filing of its own, not something that happens automatically from inactivity.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if an LLP misses Form 8 or Form 11?",
      a: `${s("llpLateFee")}, and unlike most company penalties this one is uncapped — a filing forgotten for months compounds the whole time. LLPs get less scrutiny than companies precisely because the penalty looks small per day; it rarely stays small.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is INC-20A part of this service?",
      a: `No — INC-20A is filed once, within ${s("inc20aWindow")} of incorporation, to declare that the company has started business. This service picks up from there: the filings that recur every single year for as long as the entity exists.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can you take over compliance for a company we did not incorporate?",
      a: "Yes, and it is a common starting point. We review what has and hasn't been filed to date, close any gap first, then bring the entity onto our regular annual calendar going forward.",
