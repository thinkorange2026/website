  overview: [
    `An Import Export Code (IEC) is the registration the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issues before a business can import or export goods or services commercially. DGFT allows ${s("iecOnePerPan")}, and the number itself is your business's PAN — a separate numbering series stopped once every trade registration was linked to PAN. You apply on the DGFT portal using ${s("iecFormApplication")}, and the government fee is ${s("iecGovtFee")}.`,

    `Most commercial importers and exporters need one; a few categories don't, including ${s("iecExemptCategories")}. If you're outside those categories and you plan to import or export for trade, an IEC is the entry ticket — customs will not clear a commercial shipment without one, and a bank will not process an inward or outward foreign remittance tied to trade without it either.`,

    `An IEC is ${s("iecValidity")} — you never file a renewal application. But it is not "set and forget": every IEC holder must complete an online update between ${s("iecAnnualUpdateWindow")} each year, even if nothing about the business has changed. Miss the window and DGFT deactivates the code, no notice given — which is the single most common way a business discovers its IEC has stopped working, usually at the worst possible moment, mid-shipment.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How long does IEC registration take?",
      a: `Once your documents are ready and correctly signed, DGFT typically processes a fresh application in ${s("iecProcessingTime")}. Most delays come from a mismatch between the application and your PAN or bank record, not from the DGFT queue itself — which is exactly what we check before filing.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Does my IEC expire, and do I need to renew it?",
      a: `No — an IEC is ${s("iecValidity")}. There is no renewal application, ever. What you do have to do is complete a separate annual update between ${s("iecAnnualUpdateWindow")}, confirming your details are still correct. It's a different obligation from renewal, and skipping it has real consequences.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I miss the annual update window?",
      a: `Your IEC is ${s("iecDeactivationConsequence")}. You find out the hard way, usually when a shipment or a bank remittance stalls. Reactivation is automatic and free the moment the overdue update is filed — but that can still cost you days on a live shipment, which is why we file it proactively for clients.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can one business or PAN hold more than one IEC?",
      a: `No. DGFT permits ${s("iecOnePerPan")}. If your business already has one — even from years ago, unused — you cannot apply for a fresh one; you update the existing code instead. We check this before filing to avoid a rejected duplicate application.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is an IEC compulsory for every import or export?",
      a: `For commercial trade, yes, with narrow exceptions — ${s("iecExemptCategories")}. If you're importing a personal item once, you're outside the IEC requirement; if you're a business bringing in stock to sell, you're not.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What's the government fee for IEC registration?",
      a: `${s("iecGovtFee")}, paid online on the DGFT portal at the time of filing ${s("iecFormApplication")}. There's no separate fee for the certificate itself once issued — only the annual update, which DGFT does not charge for at all.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What do I need to do after I receive my IEC?",
      a: "An IEC alone doesn't clear customs. You'll still need to register on ICEGATE, India's customs portal, and register an AD code from your bank against your IEC before your first shipment can move — a separate, short process we handle under ICEGATE Registration.",
