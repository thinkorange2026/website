  overview: [
    `A loan application is rarely rejected because the business is a bad risk. More often it is rejected, delayed or under-sanctioned because the financials presented do not let a credit officer see what they need to see — projections that do not tie back to actual performance, CMA data prepared inconsistently with the audited accounts, or a lender approached who was never going to fund this kind of business in the first place.`,

    `We do not lend money and we do not guarantee approval — no one honestly can. What we do is prepare the case properly: financial statements and projections that hold together, CMA data in the format banks actually expect, and a realistic view of which lenders and which schemes suit your situation before you spend weeks with the wrong one.`,

    `For collateral-free working capital, the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme is worth understanding regardless of which bank you approach. It backs loans up to ${s("cgtmseLimit")}, with the trust covering ${s("cgtmseCoverage")} of the lender's loss on default — cover that is offered by the bank under the scheme, not something ThinkOrange arranges directly, but worth knowing about before you agree to pledge collateral you did not need to.`,

      a: "Neither, and it is worth being clear about this. We are not a bank or NBFC and do not sanction credit. What we provide is preparation and facilitation — financial statements, CMA data, projections and lender coordination — so your application is judged fairly. The lending decision is always the bank's or NBFC's.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is CMA data and why does it matter so much?",
      a: "Credit Monitoring Arrangement data is a standardised financial presentation banks use to assess and monitor a borrower. Lenders read it closely, and if it does not tie back cleanly to your audited accounts and tax filings, it raises questions before anyone even looks at whether your business is a good risk.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is CGTMSE and can I get a loan without collateral?",
      a: `The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises backs eligible loans up to ${s("cgtmseLimit")} without collateral, with the trust covering ${s("cgtmseCoverage")} of the lender's loss if you default. Whether a specific bank offers it under the scheme, and on what terms, is confirmed with that lender — it is not automatic on every loan.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can you guarantee my loan will be approved?",
      a: "No, and be wary of anyone who says they can. What proper preparation does is remove the reasons an application gets rejected on presentation rather than substance — inconsistent figures, missing documents, an unrealistic projection. The underlying creditworthiness of the business is not something we can change, only present accurately.",
    },
    {
      q: "How far back do my financials need to go?",
      a: "Most lenders want two to three years of audited financials and tax returns, plus recent bank statements, though this varies by loan size and lender. A newer business without that history is not disqualified, but the application is built differently, usually leaning more heavily on projections and the promoter's own track record.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you help with personal loans too?",
      a: "Yes, particularly where personal borrowing needs to be presented alongside business financials — a promoter guarantee, or a mortgage taken partly against business income. Ask us directly about your specific situation.",
