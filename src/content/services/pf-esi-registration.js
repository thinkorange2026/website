// Angle: PF (EPF) and ESI are headcount-triggered obligations, not turnover-
// triggered ones like GST — that distinction is the thing most first-time
// employers get wrong, so the overview leads with it. Two separate Acts, two
// separate thresholds, one common online registration mechanism (Shram
// Suvidha) — structure the page around that shape rather than treating EPF
// and ESI as one undifferentiated "labour compliance" blob.

  overview: [
    `Provident Fund and Employees' State Insurance are two separate employer obligations that kick in once your headcount crosses a fixed number — not once your turnover does, which is what usually surprises people used to GST thresholds. Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) registration, under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952, becomes mandatory once you employ ${s("epfRegistrationThreshold")}. Employees' State Insurance (ESI) registration, under the Employees' State Insurance Act 1948, becomes mandatory once you employ ${s("esiRegistrationThreshold")} in an establishment the Act covers — which in Tamil Nadu includes shops, hotels and other non-factory establishments, not only factories.`,

    `Both counts include every person on your payroll, whatever they earn — the headcount that triggers registration is not the same as the headcount that gets enrolled. Only employees drawing up to ${s("epfWageCeiling")} are compulsorily covered under EPF, and up to ${s("esiWageCeiling")} under ESI; anyone above either ceiling can still be enrolled voluntarily, but is not required. A business can legitimately owe both registrations, one, or neither, depending on how its actual payroll is structured.`,

    `Skipping registration once you're liable is not a quiet gap — EPF's Section 14 exposes you to ${s("epfNonRegistrationPenalty")}, and ESI's Section 85 carries ${s("esiNonRegistrationPenalty")}, on top of the contributions and damages you owe for the whole unregistered period. Most cases we see were never deliberate — a business crossed a headcount threshold during a hiring push and nobody was tracking the number against either Act.`,

  whoNeedsThis: [
    `Your headcount has reached ${s("epfRegistrationThreshold")} — EPF registration is mandatory from that date, whatever your turnover.`,

    {
      q: "Does registering mean every employee is covered?",
      a: `No. Only employees drawing up to ${s("epfWageCeiling")} are compulsorily covered under EPF, and up to ${s("esiWageCeiling")} under ESI. Someone earning above either ceiling can still be enrolled voluntarily, with the employer's agreement, but is not required to be.`,

      q: "Can we register for EPF voluntarily with fewer than 20 employees?",
      a: `Yes — ${s("epfVoluntaryCoverage")}. Once granted, coverage is permanent, so you cannot drop back out later simply because headcount falls.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if we were liable and never registered?",
      a: `EPF's Section 14 exposes you to ${s("epfNonRegistrationPenalty")}, and ESI's Section 85 carries ${s("esiNonRegistrationPenalty")}. Either way you also owe the contributions and interest for the whole unregistered period, which is usually the larger number.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How are contributions actually paid each month once we're registered?",
      a: `EPF contributions are filed through the Electronic Challan-cum-Return, due by ${s("epfEcrDue")}. ESI contributions follow the same monthly rhythm, due by ${s("esiMonthlyContributionDue")}, with a further half-yearly return on top.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do EPFO and ESIC need separate applications?",
      a: `Not any more — ${s("shramSuvidhaCommonRegistration")} covers both, and both departments recognise the same Labour Identification Number for the establishment afterward, so you are not maintaining two unrelated department relationships.`,
