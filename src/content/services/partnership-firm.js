  overview: [
    `A partnership firm is the least formal way for two or more people to run a business together. It is governed by the ${s("partnershipStatute")}, needs no minimum capital, and carries almost no annual filing. The whole arrangement rests on one document: the partnership deed.`,

    `Registration of the firm is optional under the Act, which sounds convenient and is the most misunderstood point in this area. An unregistered firm can trade perfectly legally — but it cannot file a suit to enforce a contract against a third party, and a partner cannot sue the firm or the other partners to enforce rights under the deed. You keep the option of doing business and lose the option of enforcing it. That asymmetry only becomes visible when something has already gone wrong.`,

    `The trade-off against an LLP is liability. Partners in a firm carry unlimited joint liability, so a partner's business debts can reach every partner's personal assets. If that concerns you and the lighter compliance is not decisive, an LLP gives you the same flexibility with liability contained.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Is registering a partnership firm compulsory?",
      a: `No — registration is optional under the ${s("partnershipStatute")}. But an unregistered firm cannot sue to enforce a contract against a third party, and partners cannot sue each other to enforce the deed. You can trade unregistered; you cannot enforce. That is why we recommend registering.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between a partnership firm and an LLP?",
      a: "Liability. Partners in a firm carry unlimited joint liability, so business debts can reach personal assets. In an LLP, liability is limited to each partner's contribution. A firm has lighter compliance; an LLP has annual filings but contains the risk.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many partners can a firm have?",
      a: "A minimum of two. The maximum is prescribed and differs for certain professions, so confirm it with us for your case. There is no minimum capital requirement, and contributions need not be equal.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should the partnership deed cover?",
      a: "Capital contribution, profit and loss sharing, each partner's role and authority, whether the partnership is at will or fixed-term, how partners are admitted or retire, and how disputes are settled. Silence on any of these means the Act's defaults apply instead.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the stamp duty on a partnership deed?",
      a: "Stamp duty is a state subject and varies with the capital contributed, so the figure for a Tamil Nadu firm is confirmed when the deed is drafted rather than quoted in advance. Under-stamping is worth avoiding, since it affects whether the deed is admissible in evidence.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does a partnership firm need an audit?",
      a: "Not under partnership law itself. An audit may be required under income tax provisions once turnover crosses the applicable threshold. Those thresholds are currently being re-confirmed against the new income tax legislation, so we will advise on your specific figures.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can a partnership firm be converted into an LLP or a company?",
      a: "Yes, both are established routes and common once liability or funding becomes a concern. Conversion moves assets, contracts and registrations across, so the tax treatment of the transfer is worth planning before you begin rather than afterwards.",
