  overview: [
    `Registering on GeM or an e-tendering portal gets you access. Winning a specific tender is a different job — reading the tender document precisely, meeting every eligibility and technical qualification exactly as worded, and submitting a bid that cannot be rejected on a technicality before it is even evaluated on price.`,

    `That last point accounts for more lost bids than price ever does. Tenders are rejected at the technical evaluation stage for missing a signature, an expired certificate, a document in the wrong format, or a declaration that was not worded the way the tender required — none of which have anything to do with whether the bidder could actually do the work.`,

    `If your Udyam registration is current, Micro and Small Enterprises are ${s("gemEmdExemption")} under government procurement policy — the same exemption that applies on GeM, and one that is worth checking on every individual tender rather than assuming it carries over automatically.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Why do tenders get rejected before price is even considered?",
      a: "Almost always a technical or eligibility failure — a missing signature, an expired certificate, a document in the wrong format, or a declaration not worded as required. Tenders are evaluated in stages, and a technical rejection means the price bid is never opened at all.",
    },
    {
      q: "Am I exempt from Earnest Money Deposit as a small business?",
      a: `Yes — if you hold a current Udyam registration as a Micro or Small Enterprise, you are ${s("gemEmdExemption")} under government procurement policy, the same exemption GeM applies. It is worth confirming on each individual tender rather than assuming it is automatic, since the exemption depends on your certificate being current at the time of that specific bid.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if I actually qualify for a tender?",
      a: "Read the eligibility criteria literally, not generously. 'Experience in similar work' is often defined precisely by the tendering authority — a specific sector, a minimum contract value, or a certification you may not hold. We check this against your actual documents before you commit time to a full bid.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if the tendering authority raises a query on my bid?",
      a: "You get a window, usually short, to respond. Missing it is treated the same as not answering at all, so a query needs a fast, precise response — which is easier when your original bid documentation was organised properly to begin with.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you help with tenders outside Tamil Nadu?",
      a: "Yes. E-tendering portals and GeM operate nationally, so the tender itself can be issued by any state or central department, PSU or municipal body, and our support is not limited to Tamil Nadu-based opportunities. Distance from our office has no bearing on how a bid is prepared or submitted.",
