    "Formation, LLP agreement drafting and annual compliance — limited liability without the full weight of company obligations.",

  overview: [
    `A Limited Liability Partnership sits between a partnership firm and a company. Partners get limited liability, so one partner's mistake does not reach another's personal assets, but the structure avoids much of the machinery a company carries — no board meetings, no company secretary, and materially lighter annual filing.`,

    `You need ${s("llpMinPartners")}. There is no minimum capital contribution. The document that matters most is the LLP agreement, which sets out profit sharing, decision rights, what happens when a partner leaves and how disputes are settled — and it must be filed in Form 3 within ${s("llpAgreementWindow")}. Where partners skip drafting it properly, the default provisions of the LLP Act apply instead, and those are rarely what anyone actually wanted.`,

    `One feature deserves emphasis, because it is the LLP's genuine trap. Annual filings are Form 11 by ${s("llpForm11Due")} and Form 8 by ${s("llpForm8Due")}, and the late fee is ${s("llpLateFee")}. No cap. A dormant LLP that nobody filed for can accumulate a penalty larger than anything the business ever earned — and unlike a company, there is no ceiling to stop it. If you register an LLP, the filings are not optional even in a year with no activity.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How many partners do I need for an LLP?",
      a: `${s("llpMinPartners")}. There is no upper limit on the number of partners, and no minimum capital contribution. Designated partners carry the compliance responsibility, so who takes that role is worth deciding deliberately rather than by default.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What are the LLP annual filing deadlines?",
      a: `Form 11, the annual return, by ${s("llpForm11Due")}. Form 8, the statement of account and solvency, by ${s("llpForm8Due")}. Both are due every year regardless of whether the LLP traded, and both are filed with designated partners' digital signatures.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I miss an LLP filing?",
      a: `The late fee is ${s("llpLateFee")} — and the absence of a cap is the problem. A dormant LLP left unfiled for a few years can accumulate a penalty far larger than the business ever earned. This is the single strongest argument for keeping an LLP filed even when inactive.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Should I choose an LLP or a private limited company?",
      a: "An LLP for lighter annual compliance and flexible profit sharing. A company if you want outside investment, since investors generally will not take equity in an LLP. Decide on the funding question first — it settles the answer more often than anything else.",
    },
    {
      q: "How important is the LLP agreement?",
      a: `It governs everything about how the LLP operates, and must be filed within ${s("llpAgreementWindow")}. Without a properly drafted one, the LLP Act's default provisions apply, and those split profits and decision rights in ways partners rarely intend. Treat it as the main deliverable, not paperwork.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can an LLP be converted into a company later?",
      a: "Yes, and it is a common path once a business needs equity funding. Conversion is a formal process rather than a switch, and assets, contracts and registrations all have to be moved across, so it is worth planning the tax treatment before you begin.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does an LLP need an audit?",
      a: "Only above prescribed turnover and contribution limits — below those, accounts must still be maintained and Form 8 filed, but a statutory audit is not required. Confirm the current limits with us for your figures, as they determine a meaningful part of your annual cost.",
