// startups (historically under Section 80-IAC of the 1961 Act) sits squarely
// inside the Income Tax Act 2025 transition — see BLOCKERS.md §1. This page
// mentions that a tax benefit EXISTS, in general terms, without citing an old
// section number that may already be wrong, and without stating eligibility
// conditions (like the incorporation-date window) that are also under review.
// Do not "complete" this page by adding 80-IAC specifics until BLOCKERS.md §1
// is resolved — that is a trap, not a gap.

    "DPIIT recognition against the current eligibility criteria — the certificate that unlocks self-certification, easier procurement access and startup-specific schemes.",

  overview: [
    `DPIIT recognition is what "Startup India" actually means in practice — a certificate from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade confirming your business meets the government's definition of a startup. It is not automatic just because you are new or small; it is a formal application against specific criteria.`,

    `The criteria were updated recently and are worth checking against the current notification rather than an older article. As it stands, your entity must be ${s("dpiitAgeLimit")}, with turnover not exceeding ${s("dpiitTurnoverCap")}, and structured as ${s("dpiitEligibleEntities")}. A sole proprietorship cannot be DPIIT-recognised — this is the single most common reason an otherwise-eligible business gets turned away, so structure needs to be settled before you apply.`,

    `Recognition brings genuine operational benefits — self-certification under certain labour and environmental laws, easier access to government tenders and GeM's startup provisions, and eligibility for startup-specific funding schemes. Income tax benefits are also available to recognised startups meeting further conditions, but those specific conditions sit inside the income tax law currently being re-codified, so we confirm your position on that separately rather than stating it here.`,
  ],

  whoNeedsThis: [
    `Your entity is ${s("dpiitAgeLimit")} and structured as ${s("dpiitEligibleEntities")}.`,
    `Your annual turnover has not exceeded ${s("dpiitTurnoverCap")} in any financial year since incorporation.`,
    "Your business is working towards innovation, improvement of products or processes, or a scalable business model with high potential for employment or wealth creation — the substantive test DPIIT applies beyond the formal criteria.",
    "You want access to GeM's startup-specific tender provisions and government procurement relaxations.",
    "You want to explore whether the income tax and capital gains benefits available to recognised startups apply to you.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Can a proprietorship get DPIIT recognition?",
      a: `No. Eligible structures are ${s("dpiitEligibleEntities")}. A sole proprietorship is specifically excluded, which surprises founders who started as a proprietorship and only later look into Startup India. Converting to an eligible structure first is a common, straightforward step.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the turnover limit for DPIIT recognition?",
      a: `${s("dpiitTurnoverCap")}, in any financial year since incorporation, under the current criteria. This was raised from an earlier, lower cap — confirm the figure against the current notification if you are relying on something you read some time ago.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How old can my company be and still qualify?",
      a: `${s("dpiitAgeLimit")}, measured from the date of incorporation on your registration certificate — not from when you actually started operating, which is often earlier and can catch founders out.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is DPIIT recognition automatic if I meet the age and turnover criteria?",
      a: "No. DPIIT also assesses whether the business reflects genuine innovation, improvement of an existing product or process, or a scalable model with real potential for employment or wealth creation. Meeting the formal criteria gets you in the door; the substantive test is what is actually being evaluated.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does DPIIT recognition give me a tax exemption?",
      a: "Recognised startups meeting further conditions can access income tax benefits, but the specific conditions and the exemption mechanism sit within income tax law that is currently being re-codified under the new Income Tax Act. We assess your specific position separately once you are recognised, rather than quoting a general figure that may not hold.",
    },
    {
      q: "What can I actually do once I am DPIIT-recognised?",
      a: "Self-certify compliance under specified labour and environmental laws, access relaxed norms and startup-specific provisions on GeM and government tenders, and become eligible to apply for startup-specific government funding schemes. Which of these matter most depends on how your business actually operates.",
