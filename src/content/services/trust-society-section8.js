// Follows the pattern in gst-registration.js.
//
// Angle: this ONE leaf covers three legal structures (nav.js groups them as
// one route, "Trust, Society & Section 8"), so the job of the page is not to
// describe one structure but to help the reader work out which of the three
// actually fits them — then register it under the law that genuinely governs
// it in Salem/Tamil Nadu, not the law most national guides assume.
//
// Two research findings drive the whole page:
//   1. Tamil Nadu registers SOCIETIES under its OWN 1975 Act, which repealed
//      the central 1860 Act for this state. Most guides describe the 1860
//      Act by default — that is not what a Salem society actually registers
//      under.
//   2. Tamil Nadu has NO Public Trusts Act currently in force. It passed one
//      in 2020, but public sources do not confirm it was ever notified/
//      brought into force — flagged as an open question below, not asserted
//      either way. Absent a state Public Trusts Act, a public charitable
//      trust here is created by a registered trust deed under the central
//      Registration Act, 1908, same as most Indian states.
//
// INCOME-TAX EXEMPTION (the tax-benefit registration these entities often
// pursue after formation) is deliberately mentioned only in generic terms,
// with NO section number or form code — see BLOCKERS.md §1. That whole area
// sits in the Income Tax Act, which was re-codified 01-04-2026.

  overview: [
    `Trust, society and Section 8 company are the three structures Indian founders use to run a charitable, religious or community purpose with a legal identity of its own — a bank account in its own name, and continuity beyond any one founder. They are not interchangeable. A trust suits a founder or family running a defined charitable purpose with the least ongoing paperwork. A society suits a genuinely membership-run body — a resident welfare association, a professional, arts or sports organisation — where members, not a small founding group, are meant to control it. A Section 8 company suits an organisation that wants a company's governance and the credibility institutional or CSR funders often expect, in exchange for heavier compliance.`,

    `Where you register changes what governs you. A trust here is created by executing a trust deed under ${s("trustGoverningLaw")}, and ${s("trustDeedRegistrationRule")} — there being no dedicated Tamil Nadu Public Trusts Act we can confirm is currently in force for a public charitable trust. A society registers under the ${s("tnSocietiesAct")}, which repealed the central 1860 Act for this state — not the Act most national guides describe by default. A Section 8 company incorporates through SPICe+ like any other company, and ${s("section8LicenceRoute")}.`,

    `Tax exemption is a separate, later step for all three, applied for once the entity exists rather than part of registering it. We do not quote a section number or form code for that step here — it sits in the Income Tax Act, re-codified from 01-04-2026 — and will confirm the current position with you directly when you are ready for it.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Which should I choose — a trust, a society or a Section 8 company?",
      a: "It depends on who is meant to control the organisation and where funding will come from. A trust suits a founder or family running a defined charitable purpose with the least ongoing paperwork. A society suits a genuinely membership-run body, such as a resident association or a professional or arts organisation. A Section 8 company suits an organisation that wants a company's governance and credibility with institutional or CSR funders, in exchange for heavier compliance. We talk through your objects and funding plans before recommending one.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many people do I need to start each of the three?",
      a: `A trust needs ${s("trustMinTrustees")}, one of whom may also be the settlor. A society needs ${s("societyMinMembersTN")} in Tamil Nadu. A Section 8 company follows the same minimum as any private company — ${s("pvtLtdMinMembers")} — though it is usually formed with more, since a genuine membership base supports the funding case a Section 8 company is often built to make.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What law governs registering a society in Tamil Nadu?",
      a: `The ${s("tnSocietiesAct")}, not the central Societies Registration Act, 1860 that most national guides describe by default. That 1975 Act repealed the 1860 Act as it applied to Tamil Nadu, so a Tamil Nadu society registers, and is regulated, under the state Act.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Does Tamil Nadu have its own law for public charitable trusts?",
      a: "Not one we can confirm is currently in force. Most Indian states have no dedicated Public Trusts Act, and in that situation a public charitable trust is created by executing a trust deed and registering it under the central Registration Act, 1908. Tamil Nadu passed a Public Trusts Act in 2020, but we have not been able to confirm it was ever notified into force — we check its current status before advising you on this basis.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does a Section 8 company need a separate government licence?",
      a: `Yes — a licence under Section 8(1) of the Companies Act 2013 to operate without "Private Limited" in its name — but it no longer needs a separate application. ${s("section8LicenceRoute")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can a trust, society or Section 8 company apply for income-tax exemption?",
      a: "Yes, all three can separately apply for income-tax exemption and donor-benefit registration once formed — but that is a distinct application after incorporation, not something this registration includes automatically. We are not quoting section numbers or form codes for it here while the Income Tax Act's recent re-codification settles, and will advise the current position when you are ready for that step.",
    },
    {
      q: "What ongoing compliance does each structure carry?",
      a: `A trust and a society both keep books of account and file whatever annual return their own Registrar requires, which is comparatively light. A Section 8 company carries a company's compliance — audited accounts, an appointed auditor, AOC-4 within ${s("aoc4Window")} and MGT-7 within ${s("mgt7Window")} — the same filings a private limited company makes.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can I convert from one of these structures to another later?",
      a: "Conversion is possible in some directions but is genuinely involved, not a form change — converting a trust or society into a Section 8 company, for instance, means transferring assets and re-registering as a new legal entity. It is far easier to choose correctly at the start, which is the point of the structure consultation.",

      "HIGH-RISK ITEM FOR CA/CS SIGN-OFF, specifically: whether the Tamil Nadu Public Trusts Act, 2020 has actually been notified/brought into force — this page assumes it has NOT, and describes trust registration via a deed under the Registration Act 1908 accordingly. If it has since come into force, the trust half of this page needs rewriting around the state Act instead (registration authority, disqualification rules, and any Charity-Commissioner-equivalent role it creates). Also confirm: (1) whether INC-20A applies to a specific Section 8 company — it depends on whether that company has share capital, which varies, so this page deliberately does not assert an INC-20A window for Section 8 companies; (2) that INC-14/INC-15 declarations are genuinely folded into INC-9 on the current MCA portal, since portal mechanics change without notice; (3) the practical minimum-trustee figure for a trust, which is practice rather than a stated statutory number. Deliberately deferred, per BLOCKERS.md §1: any income-tax exemption/donor-benefit registration detail — no section number or form code appears anywhere on this page.",
