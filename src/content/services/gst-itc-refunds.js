  overview: [
    `Input tax credit that cannot be used often can still be refunded — the two most common routes are zero-rated exports, where you sold without charging GST but still paid it on your inputs, and inverted duty structure, where your inputs are taxed at a higher rate than your output supply and credit accumulates because it cannot be fully offset.`,

    `Both routes run through the same application, ${s("itcRefundFormApplication")}, and both are subject to the same hard limit: ${s("itcRefundTimeLimit")}. The portal does not stop you from filing late by itself — it is entirely on you to track the relevant date for each claim and file inside the window, because once it closes the credit is not refundable at all.`,

    `The claim most often overstated is inverted duty structure. The refund is ${s("itcInvertedDutyRestriction")} — clients frequently assume every input qualifies and are surprised when the computed refund is lower than expected. Get the Rule 89(5) computation right upfront and there are no surprises later.`,

      q: "Can I claim a refund on all my inputs under inverted duty structure?",
      a: `No, and this is the most common point of disappointment. The refund is ${s("itcInvertedDutyRestriction")}. Credit sitting on input services or capital goods does not qualify for this particular refund route, however genuinely it accumulated.`,
    },

      q: "How quickly is a refund actually paid?",
      a: `A complete application is acknowledged within ${s("itcRefundAcknowledgement")}.

    {
      q: "What is a deficiency memo?",
      a: "A notice that your application is incomplete or has an issue that must be corrected before it can proceed to sanction. It restarts your filing clock for that submission, so respond to it as carefully as you would the original application, not as a formality.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I claim a refund on an excess balance in my cash ledger?",
      a: "Yes — money sitting in your electronic cash ledger that you have not used can be refunded on application, separate from the export and inverted duty routes, and is generally the most straightforward of the refund categories.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why was my refund sanctioned for less than I claimed?",
      a: "Most commonly because part of the claimed credit fell outside the inverted duty restriction, or because invoices in your claim did not match your supplier's GSTR-2B reporting. A reconciliation before filing catches most of this; a rejection after filing is harder to unwind than a correction beforehand.",
