//
// SCOPE NOTE: this page is the LUT/RFD-11 mechanics page, deliberately
// distinct from gst-itc-refunds.js. That file covers the general ITC refund
// process (export refund, inverted duty, excess cash ledger) and already owns
// itcRefundFormApplication/itcRefundTimeLimit/itcRefundAcknowledgement/
// itcRefundProvisional — reused here via s() wherever the refund route is
// mentioned, rather than re-derived. This page's own job is: LUT eligibility,
// annual renewal, Form GST RFD-11 filing mechanics, and the consequence
// timeline if a LUT-backed export/realisation deadline is missed (Rule 96A).
//
// STATUTORY CARE: Rule 96A(1)(b) sets the services realisation window at
// "1 year" from invoice date — this is the CGST Rules' own figure, separate
// from RBI/FEMA's general export-realisation window, which research found was
// extended from 9 to 15 months in late 2025. Whether Rule 96A(1)(b) has been
// amended to track that FEMA change, or still independently reads "1 year",
// needs CA confirmation before publishing — flagged in review.notes below.

  overview: [
    `When you export, that supply is zero-rated — but by default you still pay Integrated GST (IGST) on it and claim the money back afterwards as a refund. A Letter of Undertaking (LUT) is the alternative: a declaration filed on ${s("lutFormNumber")} that lets you export without paying IGST in the first place, so cash is never tied up waiting on a refund. If you have already paid IGST on past exports instead, that is a separate process — see gst-itc-refunds — and the two are not mutually exclusive across your export history.`,

    `An LUT is filed entirely online and is valid for ${s("lutValidityPeriod")}. There is no automatic carry-forward: you file a fresh one before the new financial year starts, or you lose the no-payment facility from 1 April. Filing generates an Application Reference Number (ARN) immediately, and the application is deemed accepted if the jurisdictional officer takes no action within ${s("lutOfficerResponseWindow")} — no physical visit, and no separate CA or departmental attestation is required for acceptance.`,

    `Not every exporter qualifies. If you have been prosecuted for tax evasion of ${s("lutEligibilityThreshold")} or more under the CGST Act, the IGST Act or an earlier law, you cannot file an LUT and must furnish a bond instead, usually backed by a bank guarantee of ${s("lutBankGuaranteeCap")}. And an LUT is not unconditional once accepted: goods must actually leave India within ${s("lutGoodsExportWindow")} of the invoice, and payment for services must be realised within ${s("lutServicesRealisationWindow")} — miss either and IGST plus interest falls due.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is an LUT and why not just pay IGST and claim it back?",
      a: `An LUT (${s("lutFormNumber")}) is a declaration that lets you export without paying IGST at all, instead of paying it and reclaiming it through the refund process on gst-itc-refunds. It keeps cash free rather than sitting with the department pending a refund, which is why most regular exporters file one rather than exporting on payment.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long is an LUT valid, and do I need to refile it?",
      a: `${s("lutValidityPeriod")}. There is no carry-forward — you must file a fresh LUT before the new financial year begins, or you lose the no-payment facility from the start of the new financial year until a new one is accepted. We treat this as an annual renewal, not a one-time filing.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Who is not eligible to file an LUT?",
      a: `You cannot file an LUT if you have been prosecuted for tax evasion of ${s("lutEligibilityThreshold")} or more under the CGST Act, the IGST Act or an earlier law. You must furnish a bond instead, generally backed by a bank guarantee of ${s("lutBankGuaranteeCap")}, though the jurisdictional Commissioner can waive or reduce that based on your track record.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I don't export within the required time after invoicing under LUT?",
      a: `For goods, you have ${s("lutGoodsExportWindow")} from the invoice date; for services, payment must be realised within ${s("lutServicesRealisationWindow")}. Miss either and you must pay the IGST due plus interest within ${s("lutPaymentWindow")} of the deadline expiring. Fail to pay and the LUT facility is deemed withdrawn until you do — it is restored once the amount is settled.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to visit the GST office or get an attestation to file an LUT?",
      a: `No. Filing is fully online through Form GST RFD-11, authenticated by DSC or EVC, with an ARN generated immediately on submission. There is no physical document submission and no separate departmental sign-off required — the application is deemed accepted if the officer takes no action within ${s("lutOfficerResponseWindow")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Does an LUT cover supplies to an SEZ unit or developer?",
      a: "Yes. Supply to a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) unit or developer is treated as a zero-rated supply in the same way as a physical export, so the same LUT covers both — you do not need a separate declaration for SEZ supplies.",
    },
    {
      q: "I already paid IGST on some exports instead of filing an LUT. Can I still get that back?",
      a: "Yes — that is a refund claim, not an LUT matter, and it runs on its own two-year time limit from the relevant date. See gst-itc-refunds for that process; filing an LUT going forward and claiming a refund on past IGST-paid exports are not mutually exclusive.",
    },
    {
      q: "What details does the RFD-11 form itself ask for?",
      a: "Your GSTIN and PAN, and the name, occupation and address of two independent witnesses — the same two named on a running bond and bank guarantee if you ever move to that route. Companies and LLPs authenticate with a Digital Signature Certificate; other entity types can use EVC.",
