// Follows the pattern in gst-registration.js and bookkeeping.js.
//
// ⛔ Salary TDS is described GENERICALLY throughout this file — no Income Tax
// Act section number, no form name, no "Assessment Year". See BLOCKERS.md §1:
// the Income Tax Act 2025 replaced the 1961 Act on 01-04-2026, renumbering
// every section and TDS form, so naming either here would very likely be
// wrong within months of publishing. `tdsPaymentDue` (statutory.js) is the one
// safe TDS-related key — it is explicitly marked as a calendar mechanic only,
// not tied to a section number — and is the only TDS fact cited on this page.
//
// Angle: this is the RECURRING service that sits downstream of pf-esi-
// registration.js's one-time registration — make that relationship explicit
// rather than re-explaining EPF/ESI applicability from scratch.

  overview: [
    "Registering for EPF and ESI is a one-time step; running payroll correctly every month is not, and it is where most of the actual compliance risk sits. Each pay cycle has to reconcile salaries, statutory deductions and several separate government filings — EPF, ESI, Professional Tax where it applies, and salary TDS — against their own deadlines, for every employee, every month, indefinitely.",

    `We prepare and file the EPF Electronic Challan-cum-Return, due by ${s("epfEcrDue")}, and the ESI monthly contribution, due by ${s("esiMonthlyContributionDue")}. On top of both, ESI's half-yearly consolidated return is due by ${s("esiHalfYearlyReturnDue")}. None of these deadlines move together, and missing one restarts interest and damages from that specific date, not from whichever filing you remembered first.`,

    `Professional Tax on salaries in Tamil Nadu is ${s("tnProfessionalTaxMechanism")}. The specific slab table is set by each corporation separately, so we confirm the current one for wherever your staff are actually based rather than assuming another city's rates apply here. Salary TDS is deducted from every payslip and deposited each month — the calendar mechanic is stable, due by ${s("tdsPaymentDue")} — though which section and form it sits under is being re-confirmed following this year's transition to the new Income Tax Act, so we advise on that separately rather than naming it on this page.`,

      q: "Can you take over payroll from our current vendor or in-house team?",

      q: "Do you handle Professional Tax and TDS even if we don't run PF or ESI through you?",
