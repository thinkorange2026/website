// ============================================================================
// Written 19-08-2026, clearing BLOCKERS.md §1 for this leaf.
//
// This is the leaf the blocker hit hardest. Under the 1961 Act, TDS lived
// across 60-plus sections (192 to 194T) and four form numbers every Indian
// business could recite: 24Q, 26Q, 27Q, 27EQ. From 01-04-2026 all of that is
// gone: two charging sections (392 salary, 393 everything else, the latter
// using payment CODES rather than separate sections), one compliance section
// (397), and renumbered forms — 138, 140, 144, 143 for the statements, and
// 130 / 131 for the certificates people still call Form 16 and 16A.
//
// A page written from recall would have been wrong in every form number and
// every section reference while looking completely confident. Everything
// below is interpolated from statutory.js, researched 19-08-2026.
//
// DELIBERATE OMISSIONS, because they were not confirmable to the standard
// this file requires: individual TDS rates and threshold amounts per payment
// type, and the payment-code numbers under Section 393. Rates carried over
// substantively unchanged, but "substantively" is not good enough to publish
// a rate table a client might deduct on. The page says what the mechanism is
// and that the rate depends on the payment; it never asserts a percentage.

    `Monthly deduction and deposit, quarterly statements and certificates handled on one calendar — under the renumbered sections and forms that took effect on ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}.`,

  overview: [
    `Tax deducted at source makes you a collecting agent for the government. If you pay salaries, rent, contractor bills, professional fees, commission or interest above the prescribed limits, you must deduct tax before paying, deposit it by the due date, report it in a quarterly statement and issue a certificate to the person you deducted from. Four separate obligations, each with its own deadline, and the penalty structure treats them separately too.`,

    `Everything about how this is cited changed on ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}. The Income Tax Act, 2025 collapsed the old maze of sections into two: ${s("tdsSalarySection")} for salary and ${s("tdsNonSalarySection")} for every other payment, the latter using payment codes in a single table instead of a separate section per payment type. Compliance — your TAN, the quarterly statements and the certificates — sits under ${s("tdsComplianceSection")}. The forms were renumbered with it: the salary statement is now ${s("tdsFormSalaryStatement")}, resident non-salary is ${s("tdsFormNonSalaryStatement")}, and payments to non-residents are ${s("tdsFormNonResidentStatement")}.`,

    `The cost of getting it wrong falls on you, not on the person you paid. Deposit late and interest runs at ${s("tdsLateDepositInterest")}. File the statement late and the fee is ${s("tdsLateStatementFee")} under Section 427. Worse, a deductee whose credit does not appear in their Form 26AS cannot claim it — so a filing error of yours becomes their problem, and then your dispute.`,

    {
      q: "Form 24Q and 26Q have disappeared from the portal. What replaced them?",
      a: `The forms were renumbered when the Income Tax Act 2025 took effect on ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}. Salary statements moved from 24Q to ${s("tdsFormSalaryStatement")}, resident non-salary from 26Q to ${s("tdsFormNonSalaryStatement")}, non-resident payments from 27Q to ${s("tdsFormNonResidentStatement")}, and the TCS statement from 27EQ to ${s("tcsFormStatement")}. The due dates did not move — ${s("tdsQuarterlyStatementDues")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Which section do I deduct under now?",
      a: `Two, instead of the sixty-odd there used to be. ${s("tdsSalarySection")} covers salary. ${s("tdsNonSalarySection")} covers everything else — contractors, professionals, rent, commission, e-commerce and the rest — through one table of payment codes. What you are deducting for now shows up as a code rather than as its own section number.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What does it cost me if I deposit or file late?",
      a: `Late deposit runs interest at ${s("tdsLateDepositInterest")}, calculated from the date you deducted. A statement filed late attracts ${s("tdsLateStatementFee")} under Section 427 — the cap means the fee cannot exceed the tax itself, but a small deduction filed months late can reach that cap easily.`,
    },
    {
      q: "My vendor says the credit is not showing in their Form 26AS. What went wrong?",
      a: "Almost always the deductee data in the quarterly statement: a wrong PAN, the wrong quarter, or a challan that does not match. The tax has usually been paid — it just landed unattributed. A correction statement fixes it, and the credit appears against the right PAN after processing.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a TAN if I only make one or two payments a year?",
      a: `Yes, if any of those payments attract deduction. TAN is required to deposit deducted tax under ${s("tdsComplianceSection")}, and it is separate from your PAN. Holding a TAN and never filing against it also generates its own notices, so it should be either used properly or surrendered.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What if the payee gives me a lower deduction certificate?",
      a: "Then you deduct at the certificate's rate for the payments and period it covers, and report it in the statement so the reduced rate reconciles. Keep the certificate on file — it is the only defence against a short-deduction demand raised later on those payments.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I recover TDS I forgot to deduct from a vendor I have already paid?",
      a: "Commercially, that is a negotiation. Legally, the liability sits with you as the deductor: you owe the tax with interest whether or not the vendor reimburses you. It is why the payment map matters — deciding deduction before the payment goes out is much cheaper than deciding after.",
    },
    {
      q: "We deduct for our staff. Does the regime they choose change our deduction?",
      a: `Yes. Deduction under ${s("tdsSalarySection")} is computed on the employee's projected annual liability, and that depends on whether they are on the new or old regime. Collect the choice in writing at the start of the year, or the deduction is either short all year or lumped into March.`,
