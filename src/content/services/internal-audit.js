  overview: [
    `Internal audit is mandatory for some companies and optional for everyone else, and the two groups need different things from it. Under Section 138 of the Companies Act, a private company must appoint an internal auditor once turnover reaches ${s("internalAuditTurnoverThreshold")} or outstanding borrowings reach ${s("internalAuditBorrowingThreshold")} — checked against any point in the preceding financial year, not just year-end. Listed companies require it regardless of size.`,

    `Where it is not mandatory, businesses still commission internal audits voluntarily, usually once they have grown past the point where the owner can personally see every transaction. The value is the same either way: independent testing of whether your controls actually work, rather than assuming they do because a process document says they should.`,

    `We work with corporate and BFSI clients on process reviews, control testing and risk assessment, reporting findings in terms a board or management team can act on rather than a generic checklist. The output that matters is not the report — it is what changes afterward.`,

    {
      q: "Is internal audit mandatory for my company?",
      a: `For a private company, yes once turnover reaches ${s("internalAuditTurnoverThreshold")} or outstanding borrowings reach ${s("internalAuditBorrowingThreshold")}, under Section 138 of the Companies Act. Listed companies require it regardless of size. Below those thresholds it is optional, though often still worthwhile.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How is the threshold measured — at year-end or during the year?",
      a: `At any point during the preceding financial year for the borrowing threshold, not only at year-end. A company that briefly crossed ${s("internalAuditBorrowingThreshold")} in borrowings mid-year and repaid it before year-end can still trigger the requirement.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between internal audit and statutory audit?",
      a: "A statutory audit expresses an opinion on whether your financial statements are true and fair, for shareholders and regulators. Internal audit examines whether your operational controls and processes actually work, for management's own benefit. They serve different purposes and a good internal audit often makes the statutory audit smoother.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who can be appointed as internal auditor?",
      a: "A chartered accountant, cost accountant, or another professional as the board decides, and the internal auditor may be an employee or an external firm. Independence from the processes being reviewed matters more than the specific qualification.",
    },
    {
      q: "How often should internal audit be carried out?",
      a: "The Companies Act requires the audit committee or board to formulate the scope and periodicity — commonly annual for smaller companies, more frequent for higher-risk areas or larger operations. It is a decision for your board, tailored to your actual risk profile rather than a fixed rule.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens with the findings?",
      a: "They go to the audit committee or board, along with management's response and an action plan. The findings are internal — they do not get filed with the Registrar the way statutory audit reports do — but ignoring them repeatedly is itself a governance failure that a statutory auditor may eventually flag.",
