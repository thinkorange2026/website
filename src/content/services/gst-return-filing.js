// The angle that makes this page useful rather than generic: most businesses

  overview: [
    `Filing a GST return is not the hard part. Reconciling it is. Your GSTR-1 reports what you sold, your GSTR-3B carries the tax you pay, and your GSTR-2B lists the credit your suppliers have actually reported — and where those three disagree, the department notices before you do.`,

    `Which returns you file depends on your turnover. Above ${s("qrmpThreshold")} you file monthly: GSTR-1 by the ${s("gstr1DueMonthly")} and GSTR-3B by the ${s("gstr3bDueMonthly")}. At or below it you can opt into the QRMP scheme and file quarterly instead. QRMP catches people out, because quarterly filing does not mean quarterly paying — tax is still due every month through PMT-06 by the ${s("pmt06Due")}.`,

    `The deadline that matters most is not the monthly one. Under Section 39(11) a return more than ${s("gstReturnTimeBar")} past its due date can no longer be filed at all — the portal blocks it permanently and the input credit sitting in that period is gone for good. If you have old periods outstanding, that is the clock to worry about, not the late fee.`,

    `Your aggregate turnover exceeds ${s("gstr9Threshold")} and you must file the GSTR-9 annual return, or exceeds ${s("gstr9cThreshold")} and also need the GSTR-9C reconciliation statement.`,

      a: `Monthly filers submit GSTR-1 by the ${s("gstr1DueMonthly")} and GSTR-3B by the ${s("gstr3bDueMonthly")}. Under QRMP, GSTR-1 is due ${s("gstr1DueQuarterly")} and GSTR-3B ${s("gstr3bDueQuarterly")} — but tax is still paid monthly through PMT-06 by the ${s("pmt06Due")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I have to file if I had no sales in the period?",
      a: "Yes. A nil return is still a return, and not filing one attracts a late fee just as a missed liability would. It also blocks the next period, because GST returns must be filed in sequence — one skipped nil return can stall an entire year.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the QRMP scheme, and should I opt in?",
      a: `QRMP lets businesses with turnover up to ${s("qrmpThreshold")} file GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B quarterly instead of monthly. It cuts filing work, not tax outflow — payment stays monthly through PMT-06. It suits steady, predictable turnover; it suits lumpy turnover much less, because the quarterly reconciliation gets harder.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the late fee and interest for filing late?",
      a: `The late fee is ${s("gstLateFee")}, subject to a cap. Separately, interest runs at ${s("gstInterest")} on tax paid late, computed daily from the due date. The two are distinct — the fee is for the delay in filing, the interest is for the delay in paying.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can I still file a return from two years ago?",
      a: `Yes, but not indefinitely. A return more than ${s("gstReturnTimeBar")} past its due date cannot be filed at all — the portal blocks it and the period closes permanently, taking the input credit in it with it. If you have old periods open, prioritise by which is closest to that bar.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Why does my input credit not match my books?",
      a: "Usually because a supplier has not filed their GSTR-1, has filed it with your GSTIN entered incorrectly, or has reported the invoice in a later period. Your GSTR-2B only shows what suppliers actually reported, so the gap is normally theirs to fix — but the consequence lands on you.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who has to file GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C?",
      a: `GSTR-9, the annual return, applies where aggregate turnover exceeds ${s("gstr9Threshold")}. GSTR-9C, a reconciliation between your returns and your audited accounts, applies above ${s("gstr9cThreshold")}. Both are due ${s("gstr9Due")}.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the Invoice Management System?",
      a: "The IMS lets you accept, reject or hold each inward invoice your suppliers report, and your GSTR-2B is built from those decisions. Used properly it stops wrong or duplicate invoices reaching your credit claim. Ignored, it defaults to accepting whatever was filed against your GSTIN.",
