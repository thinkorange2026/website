  overview: [
    `Accurate books are the foundation every other compliance activity sits on. A GST return, an income tax filing, an audit, a loan application — all of them are only as reliable as the books behind them. Get bookkeeping wrong and every downstream filing inherits the error, usually discovered at the worst possible moment.`,

    `We maintain books in Tally Prime or Zoho Books, or work inside whatever system you already use, and close them monthly rather than leaving reconciliation for year-end. That includes bank reconciliation, accounts payable and receivable tracking, and management reports that tell you what is actually happening in the business, not just what was invoiced.`,

    `Companies must retain books of account for ${s("booksRetentionCompanies")} under the Companies Act — a period worth knowing before you archive or discard anything. The equivalent income tax retention period is currently being re-confirmed given the transition to the new Income Tax Act, so we advise on that separately rather than stating a figure that may already be out of date.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Do you work with our existing Tally or Zoho Books file?",
      a: "Yes, and it is usually simpler than migrating. We review what is there first — most existing files have a few unreconciled periods that need clearing before ongoing bookkeeping can run cleanly on top of them.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long do we need to keep our books of account?",
      a: `Under the Companies Act, ${s("booksRetentionCompanies")}. The income tax retention period is separate and is currently being re-confirmed given the transition to the new Income Tax Act, so we will advise on that figure directly rather than risk stating one that has changed.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between bookkeeping and an audit?",
      a: "Bookkeeping records and reconciles transactions as they happen. An audit independently examines books that already exist and expresses an opinion on whether they are accurate. You need bookkeeping continuously; an audit only where required or requested — and an audit is much harder to do well on books that were not kept properly in the first place.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you prepare accounts for a bank loan or investor?",
      a: "Yes. Lenders and investors want to see clean, reconciled books and consistent statements, not a set produced specifically for the application. Where your books are already maintained on a monthly basis, this is a quick extract rather than a separate project.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you handle payroll as part of bookkeeping?",
      a: "Payroll processing sits alongside bookkeeping rather than inside it by default, but the two need to reconcile with each other, so we coordinate closely where you run payroll separately. Ask us directly about your specific setup.",
    },
    {
      q: "What if our books have not been touched in over a year?",
      a: "This is common and recoverable, but it changes the scope of the first engagement — expect a catch-up phase before monthly bookkeeping begins properly. Tell us how far behind things are upfront so we can quote the clean-up realistically rather than discovering it partway through.",
