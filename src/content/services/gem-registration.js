  overview: [
    `Government procurement is a large, underused opportunity for Indian SMEs, and the barrier is usually paperwork rather than capability — a business that could easily supply a government department simply never gets registered to bid. GeM is the government's own e-marketplace for goods and services procurement, and registering as a seller is the entry point.`,

    `The benefit that actually changes the economics is the MSE exemption. If your Udyam registration is current, you are ${s("gemEmdExemption")} on GeM bids — normally 2 to 5 percent of the bid value that would otherwise sit locked as working capital. You also get a price-matching preference: where the lowest bidder is not an MSE, registered MSEs ${s("gemMsePriceMatching")}.`,

    `Both benefits depend on your Udyam certificate being current and the registered business name matching your GeM seller profile exactly — a mismatch, even a minor one, is the most common reason these benefits get denied at the point of bidding rather than at registration.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Do I need Udyam registration to sell on GeM?",
      a: "You can register on GeM without it, but you lose the benefits that make GeM worthwhile for a small business — the EMD exemption, price-matching preference and MSE-specific tender access all require a current Udyam certificate. Register for Udyam first if you do not already have it.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the EMD exemption actually worth?",
      a: `Udyam-registered Micro and Small Enterprises are ${s("gemEmdExemption")} on GeM bids. Earnest Money Deposit is typically 2 to 5 percent of the bid value, so the exemption is real working capital freed up on every bid you place, not a minor administrative saving.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is MSE price-matching?",
      a: `Where the lowest bidder on a tender is not an MSE, registered MSEs ${s("gemMsePriceMatching")}. It exists specifically to give small enterprises a route into contracts they would otherwise lose purely on price to larger bidders.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Why would my MSE benefit claim be rejected?",
      a: "Almost always because the Udyam certificate has expired, or because the business name on Udyam does not exactly match the GeM seller profile. Both are checked at the point of bidding, not at registration, so an issue can sit invisible for months before it costs you a benefit on an actual bid.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is vendor assessment on GeM?",
      a: "An additional verification step GeM applies to certain product and service categories before a seller is allowed to bid, checking capability and quality beyond basic registration. Not every category requires it — we will confirm whether yours does.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can a startup access special provisions on GeM?",
      a: "Yes, DPIIT-recognised startups have access to startup-specific tender provisions on GeM, including relaxed experience and turnover criteria in some cases. This runs alongside, not instead of, the MSE benefits if you also hold Udyam registration.",
