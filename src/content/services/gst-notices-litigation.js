//
// STATUTORY CARE: Section 74A (Finance (No. 2) Act 2024) unified the old
// 73/74 fraud/non-fraud split from FY 2024-25. Sections 73 and 74 still govern
// periods up to FY 2023-24. BOTH frameworks are live at once, depending on the
// year under demand — describing only one would be wrong for half of clients.

  overview: [
    `A GST notice is not a verdict. It is the department putting a discrepancy to you and asking you to explain it, and most of the notices we see are answerable — a credit mismatch caused by a supplier's filing, a place-of-supply classification the officer read differently, a return reconciled against the wrong period.`,

    `What the notice is called tells you how serious it is and how long you have. ${s("gstFormScrutiny")} is a scrutiny notice under Section 61 — a discrepancy in a return, with ${s("gstFormScrutinyReply")} to reply. ${s("gstFormPreNotice")} is an intimation before any formal notice, and often the cheapest moment to close a matter. ${s("gstFormShowCause")} is the formal show cause notice raising a demand. ${s("gstFormDemandOrder")} is the order after adjudication, and the point at which the only route left is appeal.`,

    `The limitation framework changed recently, and which one applies depends on the year under demand. For periods up to FY 2023-24, Sections 73 and 74 still govern — ${s("gstDemandLegacyNonFraud")} for ordinary cases, ${s("gstDemandLegacyFraud")} where fraud or wilful misstatement is alleged. From FY 2024-25, Section 74A replaced both with a single ${s("gstDemandUnifiedLimitation")} limitation. Read your notice against the right one, because an out-of-time demand is contestable on that ground alone.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "I have received an ASMT-10. What is it and how long do I have?",
      a: `${s("gstFormScrutiny")} is a scrutiny notice under Section 61. The officer has compared your returns and found a discrepancy, and wants an explanation. You reply in ${s("gstFormScrutinyReply")}. It is the least severe stage and the cheapest to resolve — answered properly, it usually ends there.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I ignore a GST notice?",
      a: "The matter proceeds without your side of it. A scrutiny notice escalates to a show cause notice, a show cause notice becomes an adjudication order assessing tax on the department's figures, and your only remaining route is an appeal that costs a pre-deposit. Ignoring it removes options; it does not remove the demand.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does the department have to raise a demand?",
      a: `It depends on the year. For periods up to FY 2023-24, ${s("gstDemandLegacyNonFraud")} for ordinary cases and ${s("gstDemandLegacyFraud")} where fraud is alleged, under Sections 73 and 74. From FY 2024-25, Section 74A applies a single ${s("gstDemandUnifiedLimitation")} limitation. A demand issued outside the applicable period is contestable on that ground alone.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What changed with Section 74A?",
      a: `Section 74A, inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2024, replaced the separate fraud and non-fraud demand routes with one framework from FY 2024-25. The limitation became a uniform ${s("gstDemandUnifiedLimitation")} — longer than the old non-fraud period, shorter than the old fraud one. Penalty still turns on whether fraud is established.`,
    },
    {
      q: "The department says my input credit is wrong because my supplier did not file. Is that my problem?",
      a: "In practice, yes, which is unfair but is how it operates — your GSTR-2B only shows what suppliers reported. The answer is evidential: invoices, proof of payment, and evidence the supply happened. Cases like these are winnable, but on documents, not on the argument that it was not your fault.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I just pay rather than fight it?",
      a: `Sometimes, and we will say so. Where the department is right, paying early through ${s("gstFormVoluntaryPayment")} limits interest and penalty and closes the matter. Contesting a demand you will lose costs fees, a ${s("gstAppealPreDeposit")} pre-deposit and years. The judgement is which situation you are actually in.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What does filing an appeal cost me upfront?",
      a: `A pre-deposit of ${s("gstAppealPreDeposit")}, paid before the appeal is admitted, plus the appeal must be filed within ${s("gstAppealWindow")}. The pre-deposit is not a penalty — it is refundable if you succeed — but it is real cash that must be found at the point of filing.`,
    },
    {
      q: "My registration has been cancelled. Can it be restored?",
      a: "Often, yes. Cancellation for non-filing can usually be revoked once the outstanding returns and dues are cleared, provided you apply within the prescribed window. The urgent part is the window, so treat a cancellation order as time-critical rather than something to resolve eventually.",

Confirm specifically: (1) that Section 74A applies from FY 2024-25 and 73/74 still govern up to FY 2023-24, as stated; (2) the condonation position on the 3-month appeal window; (3) whether the GST Appellate Tribunal route should be described, which the page currently omits; (4) that nothing here reads as a guarantee of outcome. Also confirm this page complies with the advertising restrictions on your registrations, since litigation support is the most sensitive service to advertise.",
