  overview: [
    `Banks and NBFCs commission specialised audits to verify what a borrower's financial statements alone cannot show — that stock actually exists where it is claimed, that a channel financing arrangement is being used as intended, or that a branch's day-to-day transactions are being processed correctly as they happen rather than caught at year-end.`,

    `These are engagement types defined by lender policy and regulatory guidance rather than a single statutory provision, so the scope varies by assignment. A stock audit for a working capital facility looks different from a concurrent audit of a bank branch, which looks different again from due diligence support for another CA's client. What stays constant is the standard: findings have to be verifiable, not asserted.`,

    `Most local firms do not offer this range, because it requires being comfortable in a lender's or regulator's frame of reference rather than a client's. It sits alongside our other audit and accounting work as a distinct practice area for banks, NBFCs and fellow professionals.`,

    {
      q: "Who commissions a specialised audit — the business or the bank?",
      a: "Usually the lender — a bank or NBFC commissions a stock or channel-finance audit on a borrower as a condition of the facility. Concurrent audits are commissioned by the bank itself under its empanelled auditor arrangements. A business does not typically request one of itself.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does a stock audit actually check?",
      a: "Whether the inventory a borrower has declared to the lender physically exists, is valued reasonably, and is insured. It is a verification exercise, not an accounting opinion, and is usually required periodically for working capital facilities above a certain size.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is a concurrent audit?",
      a: "An audit that runs alongside a bank branch's operations rather than after the fact — reviewing transactions close to when they happen so errors or breaches surface quickly rather than at year-end. It is a distinct engagement from a bank's annual statutory audit.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you support another CA's engagement rather than working directly with the client?",
      a: "Yes. We regularly work as an extension of another chartered accountant's team on a specific piece of due diligence, under their direction and reporting to them rather than the end client directly.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are you empanelled with banks for these audits?",
      a: "Empanelment varies by bank and is confirmed on a case-by-case basis — get in touch with the specific engagement in mind and we will confirm our standing with that institution.",
