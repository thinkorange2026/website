  overview: [
    `A proprietorship is the simplest way to trade in India, and the first thing worth understanding is that there is no such thing as registering one. A proprietorship is not a separate legal entity — legally, the business is you. There is no certificate of incorporation, no registration number and no registrar. Anyone offering you a "proprietorship registration certificate" is selling you something that does not exist.`,

    `What you actually need is the set of registrations that make a proprietorship operational, and which ones depend on what you do. GST registration if your turnover crosses the threshold or you sell inter-state or online. Udyam registration to be recognised as an MSME, which brings priority lending, tender preferences and protection on delayed payments. A Shop and Establishment registration in many cases. And a current account, which banks will open in your trade name once you can show them the right combination of the above.`,

    `The consequence of being legally identical to your business is unlimited liability — a business debt is your personal debt, and a claim can reach your personal assets. That is the real reason to move to an OPC or a company as you grow, and it matters more than the tax position. For a small, low-risk business it is an acceptable trade for near-zero compliance; for anything carrying real exposure, it is not.`,

    {
      q: "Is there a certificate for proprietorship registration?",
      a: "No, and this is worth being clear about. A proprietorship is not a separate legal entity, so there is no registrar, no registration number and no certificate. What exists are the registrations that make it operational — GST, Udyam, Shop and Establishment. Anyone selling a proprietorship certificate is selling nothing.",
    },
    {
      q: "What do I need to open a current account?",
      a: "Banks generally want at least one government registration in your trade name, most commonly GST or Udyam, plus your PAN, Aadhaar and premises proof. Requirements vary between banks, so it is worth confirming with yours before applying rather than after being turned away.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need GST registration as a proprietor?",
      a: `Only if you are liable. That means turnover above ${s("gstThresholdGoods")} for goods or ${s("gstThresholdServices")} for services, or any inter-state or e-commerce selling regardless of turnover. Below that you can register voluntarily to claim input credit, which suits some businesses and not others.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is Udyam registration and is it worth doing?",
      a: "It is MSME recognition on the Udyam portal, and it is usually worth doing because it is free and quick. It gives access to priority sector lending, preference in government tenders, and protection under the MSMED Act against delayed payment by buyers.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the liability risk of a proprietorship?",
      a: "Unlimited. Because the business is legally you, a business debt is your personal debt and a claim can reach your personal assets. For a small, low-risk business that is an acceptable trade for almost no compliance. For anything with real exposure, it is the reason to incorporate.",
    },
    {
      q: "When should I move to an OPC or a company?",
      a: "When liability starts to matter more than simplicity — you are taking on larger contracts, borrowing, hiring, or carrying stock and credit risk. Also when a client or platform will not deal with an unincorporated business. It is a risk decision more than a tax one.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is a proprietorship taxed?",
      a: "Business income is taxed as your personal income, at your applicable slab, and filed in your own return rather than a separate one for the business. The specific provisions and any presumptive scheme are being re-confirmed against the new income tax legislation, so we will advise on your figures.",
