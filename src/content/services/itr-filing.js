// Written 19-08-2026, clearing BLOCKERS.md §1 for this leaf.
//
// THE BLOCKER AND WHY THIS PAGE IS NOW WRITEABLE. From 01-04-2026 the Income
// Tax Act, 2025 replaced the 1961 Act — not an amendment, a re-codification.
// Every section reference on a page like this had to be re-researched rather
// than recalled, which is exactly why the leaf sat blocked. Every number,
// section and form below comes from statutory.js, researched on 19-08-2026
// and carrying its own source.
//
// PRESENTATION CHOICE: BLOCKERS.md §1 Option A — lead with the 2025 Act, and
// say plainly that income earned up to 31-03-2026 is still governed by the
// 1961 Act. Forward-looking, correct for longest, and it does not force a
// second competing page. Option B (lead with the outgoing regime) goes stale
// within months; Option C (a page per regime) is two thin pages competing for
// one search intent.
//
// VOCABULARY IS LOAD-BEARING: this page never says "Assessment Year". That
// concept was abolished, not renamed — there is one TAX YEAR now. Copy that
// still says AY is copy written against a repealed Act, and on a tax
// consultancy's own site that is the most visible possible error.

  overview: [
    `Filing an income tax return is how you tell the department what you earned and what tax you have already paid on it, through salary deductions, advance tax and tax deducted at source. It is also what you produce when a bank underwrites a loan, when a tender asks for three years of financials, or when a visa application asks for proof of income. A return you filed carelessly is a document you will be asked to stand behind for years.`,

    `The ground has moved. From ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")} the Income Tax Act, 2025 replaced the 1961 Act, and returns are now filed under ${s("itrReturnSection")}, which folds original, belated, revised and updated returns into a single provision. "Assessment Year" no longer exists — there is one ${s("taxYearConcept")}. Income earned up to 31 March 2026 is still governed by the old Act even though you are filing in the new era, which is the part that catches people out.`,

    `Deadlines now run in three tiers rather than two: ${s("itrDueDateIndividuals")} for salaried and simple-income filers, ${s("itrDueDateNonAuditBusiness")} for non-audit business and professional cases, and ${s("itrDueDateAudit")} where an audit applies. Miss them and a fee applies under Section 428 (${s("itrLateFee")}), plus interest at ${s("itrLateFilingInterest")}. The larger cost is usually invisible: you also lose the right to carry forward most losses.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "The Income Tax Act changed in 2026. Does that affect the return I am filing now?",
      a: `Yes, in vocabulary and procedure. Returns are now filed under ${s("itrReturnSection")} of the Income Tax Act 2025, and "Assessment Year" has been replaced by a single ${s("taxYearConcept")}. Income earned up to 31 March 2026 is still taxed under the 1961 Act. So the law that computes your income and the law that governs the filing can differ for the same return.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is my due date?",
      a: `There are three tiers now, not two. ${s("itrDueDateIndividuals")} if you are salaried or have simple income, ${s("itrDueDateNonAuditBusiness")} for non-audit business and professional cases including partners, and ${s("itrDueDateAudit")} where an audit applies. Transfer pricing cases get ${s("itrDueDateTransferPricing")}. Tell us your income sources and we will confirm which applies to you.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What does filing late actually cost?",
      a: `A fee of ${s("itrLateFee")} under Section 428, plus interest at ${s("itrLateFilingInterest")} on tax still unpaid. The larger cost is usually invisible: file after the due date and you lose the right to carry most losses forward, so a loss you could have set against next year's profit is simply gone.`,
    },
    {
      q: "I have already filed and then found a mistake. Can I fix it?",
      a: `Usually yes. A revised return can be filed within ${s("itrRevisedWindow")}. If that window has closed, an updated return is available within ${s("itrUpdatedReturnWindow")}, but it carries additional tax of ${s("itrUpdatedReturnAdditionalTax")}. Correcting a mistake yourself is always cheaper than having it found during scrutiny.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Should I file under the new regime or the old one?",
      a: "It depends entirely on your numbers, and the answer changes as your investments and loans change. We compute both on your actual figures before filing rather than assuming. Broadly the new regime suits those with few deductions to claim; the old one can still win where a home loan, rent and long-standing investments stack up.",
    },
    {
      q: "My income is below the exemption limit. Is there any point filing?",
      a: "Often yes. If tax was deducted from your interest or contract payments, a return is the only way to get it refunded. A filed return is also the income proof banks and consulates ask for, and a consistent filing record makes a future notice about an unfiled year far less likely.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a tax audit?",
      a: `Under ${s("taxAuditSection")}, an audit applies where business turnover crosses ${s("taxAuditTurnoverThreshold")}, or professional gross receipts cross ${s("taxAuditProfessionThreshold")}. It also applies if you declare profits below the presumptive rates under ${s("presumptiveTaxationSection")}. The report is due ${s("taxAuditReportDue")}, so it drives your whole filing calendar.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a refund take?",
      a: "It depends on when the return is processed, and the department may issue an intimation at any point up to the outer limit set by the Act. Refunds are usually credited within weeks of processing where the bank account is pre-validated and the return matches Form 26AS. Mismatches and past demands adjusted against the refund are the two common delays.",
