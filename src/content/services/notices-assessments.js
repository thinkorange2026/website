// Written 19-08-2026, clearing BLOCKERS.md §1 for this leaf — the fourth
// Income Tax leaf, added to the category by the 17-08-2026 menu restructure
// and blocked for the same reason as the other three.
//
// EVERY SECTION NUMBER ON THIS PAGE MOVED ON 01-04-2026. The numbers an
// Indian business owner has heard for thirty years — 143(1), 143(2), 148,
// 144 — are all repealed citations now: assessment is Section 270, best
// judgment is 271, faceless is 273, reassessment notice is 280. The page
// gives the OLD number in brackets exactly once per concept, because a
// reader arriving with a notice in hand searched for the old number and
// needs to recognise where they are. That is orientation, not the citation.
//
// SECOND-HIGHEST-RISK PAGE ON THE SITE, after gst-notices-litigation, and for
// the same reason: someone may act on it while a reply window is running.
// Same discipline applied — no outcome is promised anywhere, and the page
// says plainly that sometimes the department is right.

    "From a processing intimation to a faceless scrutiny or a reassessment notice — read properly, answered on evidence, and filed inside the window.",

  overview: [
    `Most income tax notices are not accusations. The department now cross-checks every return against the data it already holds from banks, employers, registrars and stock exchanges, and a mismatch generates a communication automatically. What determines how it ends is almost never the strength of your case at the start — it is whether the reply went in on time, and whether it was supported by documents rather than explanation.`,

    `The framework was re-codified on ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}. Processing of a return and scrutiny both sit under ${s("assessmentSection")} of the Income Tax Act 2025, the successor to the old Section 143. An intimation on a processed return cannot be issued after ${s("intimationOuterLimit")}, and a scrutiny notice must be served within ${s("scrutinyNoticeWindow")}. Where income is alleged to have escaped assessment, the notice comes under ${s("reassessmentNoticeSection")}, replacing the notice everyone knew as Section 148.`,

    `Assessment is now faceless by default under ${s("facelessAssessmentSection")} — conducted electronically through the National Faceless Assessment Centre, with no officer to visit and no relationship to rely on. That cuts both ways. It removes discretion, and it means a reply that is not complete and self-explanatory on the page has nothing else supporting it. Ignore the process entirely and the officer proceeds to a best judgment assessment under ${s("bestJudgmentAssessmentSection")}, on their figures rather than yours.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "I got a notice quoting a section number I do not recognise. Has something changed?",
      a: `Yes. The Income Tax Act 2025 renumbered everything from ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}. What used to be Section 143 is now ${s("assessmentSection")}, best judgment assessment is ${s("bestJudgmentAssessmentSection")}, and the reassessment notice formerly under Section 148 is now ${s("reassessmentNoticeSection")}. The provisions largely do the same work; the citations moved. Send us the notice and we will tell you what stage you are at.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is an intimation a notice? Do I need to do anything?",
      a: "An intimation is the result of your return being processed. If it agrees with your computation, nothing is needed. If it shows extra tax, something did not match — often a TDS credit, an arithmetical adjustment or a deduction disallowed as apparent from the return. It has a response window, so it should not be left.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is a faceless assessment, and can I meet the officer?",
      a: `Assessment is conducted electronically under ${s("facelessAssessmentSection")} through the National Faceless Assessment Centre, with no assigned local officer. Everything happens through e-proceedings. A video hearing can be requested in the prescribed circumstances, but the written submission carries the case — it must be complete and self-explanatory on its own.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long does the department have to open a scrutiny?",
      a: `A scrutiny notice must be served within ${s("scrutinyNoticeWindow")} under ${s("assessmentSection")}. Reassessment for income alleged to have escaped assessment runs on a different and longer footing under ${s("reassessmentNoticeSection")}, and depends on the information relied on. A notice outside its window is challengeable on that basis alone.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I just ignore it?",
      a: `The proceeding continues without your side of it. The officer can complete a best judgment assessment under ${s("bestJudgmentAssessmentSection")} on the material available, which means their figures rather than yours, and a demand follows. Ignoring a notice removes your options; it does not remove the liability.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Should I pay the demand or fight it?",
      a: "Sometimes paying is right, and we will say so. Where the department has it correct, paying early stops interest and closes the matter. Where it is an arithmetical or credit error, rectification is faster and cheaper than an appeal. Contesting is for orders that are actually wrong, not for demands that are merely unwelcome.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does filing an appeal involve?",
      a: `A first appeal is filed within ${s("appealFirstLevelWindow")}, electronically, with tax on the returned income paid. Appeals are heard faceless through the National Faceless Appeal Centre. The Act directs that appeals be decided ${s("appealDisposalTimeline")} — that is a direction to the authority, not a timeline you can hold anyone to.`,
    },
    {
      q: "The notice is about a year my previous accountant handled. Can you still take it?",
      a: "Yes, and it is common. We work from the return, the portal record and your bank data rather than from whatever files were handed over. Where the earlier position is indefensible we will tell you plainly, because the reply is filed in your name and has to be one you can stand behind.",

      "SECOND-HIGHEST-RISK PAGE ON THE SITE — a visitor may act on it while a response window is running. Confirm specifically: (1) every renumbered section against the Act as passed, not a secondary summary; (2) the reassessment limitation periods, which this page deliberately does NOT state — it says only that they are longer and depend on the information relied on; (3) whether the first appeal lies to the Joint Commissioner (Appeals) under Section 356 or to the Commissioner (Appeals) in the cases this page's readers will typically face, since the page avoids naming the authority for that reason; (4) the pre-deposit position on a first appeal, stated here only as tax on the returned income; (5) that nothing here reads as a guarantee of outcome. The appeal FORM number is deliberately omitted — one secondary source reports Form 99 replacing Form 35 from April 2026 and that was not corroborated.",
