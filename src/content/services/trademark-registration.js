    `A registered trademark gives you the exclusive right to use your mark for the goods or services you've registered it under, and the standing to stop someone else from trading under something confusingly similar. You apply on Form ${s("tmFormApplication")} through the IP India portal, choosing from ${s("tmClassesTotal")} covering every category of goods and service — one class per type of product or service you actually trade in, not one blanket filing for the whole business.`,

    `The government fee is ${s("tmFeeStandardApplicant")} for individuals, proprietors and MSME or DPIIT-recognised startup applicants filing online, and ${s("tmFeeOtherApplicant")} for partnerships, LLPs and companies without that status — per class, so filing in three classes multiplies the fee by three. Filing through an agent additionally needs a Power of Attorney on Form ${s("tmFormPowerOfAttorney")}.`,

    `Once accepted, your mark is published in the Trade Marks Journal, opening a ${s("tmOppositionWindow")} for anyone to oppose it. If nobody does, registration follows; if someone does, it becomes a contested proceeding with its own timeline. Once registered, protection runs for ${s("tmValidityPeriod")}, renewable indefinitely — there's no cap on how many times you can renew, only a deadline each time.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How long does trademark registration actually take?",
      a: `Realistically, months rather than weeks — examination alone can take some time depending on Registry workload, and an unopposed mark still has to clear the full ${s("tmOppositionWindow")} before registration follows. Anyone promising a firm number in weeks is describing the filing step, not the registration.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What are trademark classes, and do I need more than one?",
      a: `India uses ${s("tmClassesTotal")} to categorise every kind of goods and service. You need a separate class — and pay a separate fee — for each distinct category you trade in. A clothing brand that also sells accessories typically needs two classes, not one.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What does trademark registration cost in government fees?",
      a: `${s("tmFeeStandardApplicant")} if you're an individual, proprietor, or hold a valid Udyam or DPIIT certificate; ${s("tmFeeOtherApplicant")} otherwise — per class, e-filed. A company registering one mark in two classes without that status pays the higher rate twice.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if someone opposes my trademark application?",
      a: `Anyone can file an opposition within the ${s("tmOppositionWindow")} after publication — a fixed window that cannot be extended. You then file a counter-statement, and it becomes a contested proceeding before the Registrar, with its own evidence stages on both sides. It adds real time, and sometimes real cost.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a trademark registration last, and can it lapse?",
      a: `${s("tmValidityPeriod")}, renewable indefinitely — there's no limit on renewals. Miss the renewal deadline and there's ${s("tmRenewalGracePeriod")} to restore it before it's removed from the register altogether. After that, you'd have to reapply from scratch, losing your original filing date.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a Digital Signature Certificate to register a trademark?",
      a: "Yes — every e-filed application has to be digitally signed with a Class 3 DSC mapped to the applicant's IP India account; a scanned or physical signature isn't accepted online. We issue Class 3 certificates ourselves, so this doesn't become a separate errand before you can file.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I trademark my logo, my business name, or both?",
      a: "Both, if you can — they protect different things. A wordmark protects the name however it's styled; a logo (device) mark protects the specific visual design. Many businesses register the name first, since that's usually what a competitor copies first, and add the logo later.",

The counter-statement window and opposition evidence stages were researched but deliberately kept out of this leaf's own timeline table, since they only apply once a mark is actually opposed.",
