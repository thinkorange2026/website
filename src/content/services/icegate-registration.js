  overview: [
    "ICEGATE is the Indian Customs EDI System — the portal the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) uses to receive shipping bills, bills of entry and every other electronic customs filing. Holding an IEC gets you the right to trade; registering on ICEGATE is what lets you actually file the documents customs needs to release your cargo. You can't skip straight to shipping — without this registration, a shipping bill simply cannot be filed against your IEC.",

    `Alongside ICEGATE registration itself, you need to register an AD (Authorised Dealer) Code — a ${s("icegateAdCodeLength")} number your bank issues once you hold a current account with them, confirming they'll handle the foreign exchange side of your trade. ${s("icegateAdCodeScope")}.`,

    "The two most common ways this goes wrong: registering with the wrong role on ICEGATE for what you actually do (importer, exporter, or customs broker are different roles with different document requirements), and assuming the AD code covers everything a port needs — it doesn't. Duty refunds and IGST credits are still routed by your bank branch's own IFSC code, which has to be registered separately at each port you actually export from.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Is ICEGATE registration different from getting an IEC?",
      a: "Yes, and you need both. The IEC is DGFT's registration confirming you can trade; ICEGATE is CBIC's customs portal, and registering on it is what lets you actually file a shipping bill or bill of entry against that IEC. One doesn't substitute for the other.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is an AD code and why does customs ask for it?",
      a: `An AD (Authorised Dealer) Code is a ${s("icegateAdCodeLength")} number your bank issues, confirming it's authorised to handle the foreign exchange for your import or export. Customs links it to your IEC so export incentives and duty refunds are credited to the right account, and won't process a shipping bill without it.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to register my AD code separately at every port?",
      a: `No — ${s("icegateAdCodeScope")} What still has to be done port-by-port is registering your bank branch's IFSC code, specifically for receiving duty refunds and IGST credits at each port you export from. That distinction trips up more businesses than the AD code itself.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a government fee for ICEGATE or AD code registration?",
      a: `${s("icegateGovtFee")}. Your bank may charge its own processing fee for issuing the AD code letter, and a Class 3 DSC has its own issuance cost — neither of those is a government charge, but budget for both.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a Digital Signature Certificate for ICEGATE?",
      a: "Yes — ICEGATE registration and most of the filings that follow it (shipping bills, bills of entry) require a Class 3 DSC mapped to your account. We issue Class 3 certificates ourselves, so this doesn't become a separate errand before you can even register.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does the whole process take?",
      a: `Once your AD code letter is in hand and your documents are ready, customs typically validates the ICEGATE registration in ${s("icegateProcessingTime")}. The AD code letter itself usually takes the longest, since it depends on your bank's own internal process, not on us or on customs.`,
    },
    {
      q: "We changed our bank account — does the AD code need updating?",
      a: "Yes. An AD code is tied to a specific bank account, so switching accounts or banks means getting a fresh AD code letter and re-registering it on ICEGATE against your IEC before your next shipment — the old registration doesn't carry over automatically.",
