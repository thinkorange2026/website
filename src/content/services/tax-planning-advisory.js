// Written 19-08-2026, clearing BLOCKERS.md §1 for this leaf.
//
// THE RISK ON THIS PAGE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE. Filing, TDS and
// notices are procedural — they go wrong by citing a repealed section. A
// planning page goes wrong by drifting into advice: a page that says "choose
// the new regime" or "invest here to save tax" is giving personalised
// financial advice to a reader whose numbers it has never seen. So this page
// states the MECHANISMS and what the comparison depends on, and every
// recommendation is explicitly deferred to a review of the client's actual
// figures. No worked example, no "you could save X", no product named.
//
// Slab rates, the standard deduction and the rebate are the most frequently
// changed facts on the site — every Finance Act can move them. They live in
// statutory.js with a note saying exactly that, and are interpolated here so
// one edit updates the page.
//
// The rebate line carries TWO caveats that must never be dropped in a rewrite:
// the ₹12 lakh figure is taxable income AFTER the standard deduction, and the
// rebate does not extend to income taxed at special rates. A page stating the
// headline without them is the single most misread number in Indian tax.

  overview: [
    `Tax planning is not what happens in March. By then almost every decision that affects your liability has already been made: how the business is structured, when an asset was sold, whether income sits in one hand or several, whether advance tax was paid on schedule. Planning is choosing those things deliberately, with the tax consequence known in advance, and doing it while there is still time to act differently.`,

    `The framework itself changed on ${s("incomeTaxAct2025Commencement")}, when the Income Tax Act, 2025 replaced the 1961 Act and abolished "Assessment Year" in favour of a single ${s("taxYearConcept")}. Rates for individuals still run on two regimes. The new regime is ${s("newRegimeSlabs")}, with a standard deduction of ${s("standardDeductionNewRegime")} on salary and pension. The old regime is ${s("oldRegimeSlabs")}, with a standard deduction of ${s("standardDeductionOldRegime")} but access to the deductions the new regime gives up.`,

    `Which is better is arithmetic on your numbers, not a general truth — and it changes as a home loan, rent or investments change. Under ${s("rebateSection")}, the new regime carries a rebate of ${s("rebateNewRegime")}, but that threshold is taxable income after the standard deduction, and it does not apply to income taxed at special rates such as capital gains. That last point is the most misread number in Indian tax, and it is why this page compares rather than recommends.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Which regime should I choose?",
      a: `It depends on your numbers, and the honest answer is that nobody can tell you without them. The new regime runs ${s("newRegimeSlabs")}; the old one keeps the deductions the new one gives up. Broadly the old regime can still win where a home loan, rent and long-standing investments stack up. We compute both and show you the figures.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Is it true the new regime means no tax at all for most salaried people?",
      a: `Under the new regime, ${s("rebateSection")} gives a rebate of ${s("rebateNewRegime")}. Two caveats decide whether it applies to you: that is taxable income after the standard deduction, and the rebate does not extend to income taxed at special rates, such as capital gains. Both are routinely missed, and both change the answer.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can I change regime every year?",
      a: "The flexibility differs between salaried individuals and those with business income, and choosing a regime with business income has consequences for later years. This is exactly the sort of point worth confirming for your own case before you commit, rather than after a return has been filed on the assumption.",
    },
    {
      q: "When should tax planning happen?",
      a: "Early in the year, while decisions are still open. By March the only remaining lever is usually a last-minute investment, which is the weakest form of planning and often a poor investment decision as well. Structure, timing and advance tax all have to be handled while there is a year left to run.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I underpay advance tax?",
      a: `Interest at ${s("advanceTaxShortfallInterest")} under Section 424, the successor to Section 234B. The instalment schedule is ${s("advanceTaxInstalments")}. For anyone with variable income the practical answer is to project quarterly rather than annually, because the interest accrues on the shortfall at each stage, not just at year end.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Would incorporating a company save me tax?",
      a: "Sometimes, and sometimes it costs more than it saves once audit, filing and ROC compliance are counted. The rate is only one input; how you take money out of the company matters as much. We look at the full picture for your scale rather than comparing headline rates.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you recommend specific investments?",
      a: "No. We tell you the tax effect of a category of investment and how it interacts with your regime choice, so you can decide with your financial adviser. Recommending products is regulated advice and a different service from tax planning — treat anyone offering both as one thing with caution.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is tax planning the same as tax avoidance?",
      a: "No. Planning means arranging genuine affairs to use reliefs the law provides — choosing a regime, timing a sale, structuring a business. Arrangements that exist only to create a tax result are a different thing and attract anti-avoidance scrutiny. We work on the first side of that line and will say so when a suggestion crosses it.",

Also confirm the page reads as comparison rather than personalised financial advice — it deliberately names no investment product, gives no worked example and quantifies no saving, and that restraint should survive review. The regime-switching FAQ deliberately does not state the rule; if the CA wants it stated, it needs a statutory key.",
