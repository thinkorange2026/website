  overview: [
    `Udyam is the government's registration for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, and it is free, done entirely online, and valid for the life of the business. What it unlocks is real: priority sector lending, collateral-free credit guarantee schemes, preference in government tenders, and — for many businesses the most valuable protection of all — a statutory 45-day payment deadline enforceable against your buyers.`,

    `The classification limits were revised with effect from 01-04-2025, and much of what is published online still states the older, now-superseded figures. Under the current limits, a Micro enterprise is one with ${s("udyamMicroLimit")}; Small is ${s("udyamSmallLimit")}; Medium is ${s("udyamMediumLimit")}. Both the investment and turnover conditions must be met — crossing either one moves you up a category.`,

    `Classification is not something you apply for separately each year. It is ${s("udyamReclassification")} — the portal checks your filed ITR and GST data and reclassifies you automatically, up or down, without a fresh application.`,

      q: "Does Udyam registration cost anything?",

    },
    {
      q: "How does reclassification work?",
      a: `Automatically. The portal reviews the ITR and GST data you file each year and moves you up or down a category if your investment or turnover crosses a threshold — ${s("udyamReclassification")}. You do not file a separate application for this.`,

Beyond that, ${s("msmedDelayedInterest")}, and this interest cannot be waived by contract and is not deductible for the buyer as a business expense. It is one of the strongest statutory protections available to a small supplier.`,

      q: "Can a proprietorship or partnership register on Udyam, or only companies?",

    },
    {
      q: "Does Udyam registration help with government tenders?",
      a: "Yes — it is the basis for the MSE benefits on GeM and other government procurement: EMD exemption and a price-matching preference where the lowest bidder is not an MSE. Both depend on the certificate being current at the time you bid.",
