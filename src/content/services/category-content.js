// CATEGORY HUB CONTENT (T3) — CONTENT-PLAN.md §8.
//
// Separate from the leaf files in this directory because a hub's copy
// describes the PRACTICE AREA, not a specific service — it doesn't carry a
// `fees`/`documents`/`process` shape and isn't part of the T2 schema
// `_schema.js` validates. Kept alongside the leaves (not in nav.js) because
// nav.js is IA — paths, labels, parent/child structure — and must stay free
// of prose per CONTENT-PLAN.md §13's content-layer split.
//
// Same discipline as every leaf file even though `content:check`'s scanner
// only walks src/content/services/<slug>.js (one leaf per file, per its own
// comment): no invented numbers, no rupee amounts, no day counts, no form
// codes. Where a fact-shaped claim was tempting (a threshold, a scheme name)
// it was either left out or phrased generically enough to need no citation.
// Income-tax content in particular avoids every section number, form code
// and date around the 01-04-2026 Income Tax Act 2025 transition — see
// BLOCKERS.md §1 — while still being honest that the change happened.
