  overview: [
    `A Private Limited Company gives you a separate legal identity, limited liability for its shareholders, and the structure investors expect. It is the right choice if you intend to raise funding, bring in partners on defined equity, or sign contracts that outlive any one individual. It is the wrong choice if you want minimal paperwork — a company carries the heaviest ongoing compliance of any Indian structure.`,

    `The requirements are lighter than most people expect. You need ${s("pvtLtdMinMembers")}, up to a maximum of ${s("pvtLtdMaxShareholders")} shareholders, and one person can be both a director and a shareholder — so two people are enough. On capital: ${s("companyMinCapital").toLowerCase()}. The belief that ₹1 lakh is required has been wrong since 2015, and it still puts people off incorporating.`,

    `Incorporation itself runs through SPICe+, which covers ${s("spicePlusScope")} in a single application. The part that catches people out comes after. You must file INC-20A, the declaration of commencement of business, within ${s("inc20aWindow")} — and until you do, the company cannot legally begin trading or borrow. Add the auditor appointment and the annual AOC-4 and MGT-7 filings, and a company that was incorporated cheaply becomes expensive if nobody is tracking the dates.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How much capital do I need to start a private limited company?",
      a: `${s("companyMinCapital")}. You declare an authorised share capital, but there is no floor you must actually bring in. The old ₹1 lakh requirement was removed by the Companies (Amendment) Act 2015 and still puts people off unnecessarily.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How many people do I need?",
      a: `${s("pvtLtdMinMembers")}, and the same person can hold both roles — so two people are enough to incorporate. The maximum is ${s("pvtLtdMaxShareholders")} shareholders, not counting employees holding shares under an ESOP. Directors must be individuals, not other companies.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is INC-20A and why does it matter so much?",
      a: `It is the declaration that your company has commenced business, and it must be filed within ${s("inc20aWindow")}. Until it is filed the company cannot legally trade or borrow. It is the single most commonly missed post-incorporation step, and the consequences are disproportionate to how small the filing is.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Should I choose a company or an LLP?",
      a: "A company if you want outside investment, defined equity or a structure investors recognise. An LLP if you want limited liability with materially lighter annual compliance and no plans to raise funding. The compliance difference is the real deciding factor, not the incorporation cost.",
    },
    {
      q: "What ongoing compliance does a company carry?",
      a: `An annual general meeting, audited accounts, an appointed auditor, AOC-4 within ${s("aoc4Window")}, MGT-7 within ${s("mgt7Window")}, board meetings through the year, and director KYC. This is real, recurring work — budget for it before incorporating rather than discovering it later.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do all directors need a Digital Signature Certificate?",
      a: "Every director signing the incorporation application needs a Class 3 DSC, and directors who sign later filings need to keep one current. We issue Class 3 certificates ourselves, so it stays part of the same engagement rather than a separate errand.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I register the company at my home address?",
      a: "Yes. A residential address is acceptable as the registered office, provided you can produce ownership or rent proof and the owner's No Objection Certificate. You can change the registered office later, though a change between states is a longer process than a change within one.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I convert my existing proprietorship or partnership into a company?",
      a: "Yes, and it is common once turnover or risk grows. Conversion is more involved than a fresh incorporation because assets, contracts and registrations have to move across, and the tax treatment of the transfer needs planning before you start rather than after.",

Confirm the two-month recency rule for director address proof, which is practice rather than a stated rule.",
