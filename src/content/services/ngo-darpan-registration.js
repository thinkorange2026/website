  overview: [
    "NGO Darpan is the database NITI Aayog and the National Informatics Centre maintain for every voluntary organisation and non-profit in India. Registering on it doesn't create your NGO — you need an already-registered Trust, Society or Section 8 Company first — it records that organisation in the government's own system and issues it a unique Darpan ID.",

    `That ID is what several other, more consequential processes actually check for. A company ${s("ngoDarpanCsr1Requirement")}. Any application for FCRA registration, prior permission, renewal or annual return filing ${s("ngoDarpanFcraRequirement")}. Many state and central grant schemes ask for it too, as the first line of eligibility before they'll look at anything else in your application.`,

    `Registration itself is straightforward and ${s("ngoDarpanFee")}, but it's ${s("ngoDarpanVerificationTime")} — worth starting well before you actually need the ID for a specific application, not the week a grant deadline is due. Darpan registration is separate from, and does not by itself grant, income-tax exemption or donor tax-benefit registration for your NGO — that's a different application under a different law, decided independently.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is NGO Darpan and who needs to register on it?",
      a: "It's NITI Aayog's database of voluntary organisations and non-profits, and any already-registered Trust, Society or Section 8 Company that wants to apply for government grants, CSR funding or FCRA needs a Darpan ID from it. It doesn't register the NGO itself — that has to already exist.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a government fee for NGO Darpan registration?",
      a: `${s("ngoDarpanFee")}. What takes time is verification, not payment — there's nothing to pay at any stage of the process, on the portal's own side.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do I really need a Darpan ID for CSR funding?",
      a: `Yes, and it's a hard requirement, not a preference. A company ${s("ngoDarpanCsr1Requirement")} A corporate CSR team cannot legally route funds to your NGO without that filing existing, whatever else your organisation offers.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Does FCRA registration also require a Darpan ID?",
      a: `Yes. Any FCRA registration, prior permission, renewal or annual return filing ${s("ngoDarpanFcraRequirement")} If you're planning to receive foreign contributions at any point, get the Darpan ID in place well before you file the FCRA application itself.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long does verification take, and can I speed it up?",
      a: `Typically ${s("ngoDarpanVerificationTime")}, and the portal doesn't offer an expedited track. The one thing genuinely in your control is submitting documents that are internally consistent the first time — mismatches between your registration certificate and the portal entry are what usually cause a resubmission and restart the clock.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Does NGO Darpan registration also give us income-tax exemption?",
      a: "No. Darpan registration confirms your organisation's existence in NITI Aayog's database — it does not grant income-tax exemption or donor tax-benefit status. Those are separate applications under a different law, assessed on their own criteria, and having a Darpan ID doesn't shortcut either of them.",
    },
    {
      q: "Our trustees changed — do we need to update our Darpan record?",
      a: "Yes. The governing body listed on your Darpan profile should match who's actually running the organisation today. An outdated listing is a common reason a grant-making body or a CSR team flags an application for extra scrutiny, even when the underlying registration is perfectly valid.",
