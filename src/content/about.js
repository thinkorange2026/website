  // Moved out of the About template's JSX (21-08-2026), where these four were
  // an unmarked <ul> inside a card. Same four claims, same wording, split into
  // title + body so the page can set them the way the site actually sets a
  // four-point differentiator block — the oversized mono numerals of
  // DESIGN.md §11.4 / the homepage's WhyThinkOrange. Nothing new is asserted.
  //
  // ⚠️ These deliberately stay SEPARATE from `WhyThinkOrange.jsx`'s own
  // `differentiators`, which say the same four things at greater length for
  // the homepage. Both trace to CONTENT-PLAN.md §1's confirmed facts. If they
  // are ever unified, unify them in a shared content module and have both
  // pages read from it — do not let one page quote the other's private array.
