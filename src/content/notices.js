// NOTICES — the single source behind two surfaces: the homepage's moving
// notice bar (`NoticeTicker`) and the `/dsc` notice board (`NoticeBoard`).
// Added 04-09-2026 on Clinton's request for both.
//
// ⛔ READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A NOTICE. A notice board is the single easiest
// place on a compliance firm's site to publish something unsourced, because
// the format invites short, confident, dated statements — which is exactly
// what CLAUDE.md's non-negotiables and CONTENT-PLAN.md §1.1's hold list exist
// to stop. So:
//
//   1. NEVER invent a deadline, a fee, a discount, an offer, a turnaround or a
//      "from <date>" announcement here. A statutory date or threshold goes in
//      `statutory.js` with its basis and source and is interpolated with
//      `s("key")` — never typed as a literal, exactly as in a service leaf.
//      A ThinkOrange turnaround goes in `turnaround.js` with `value: null`.
//   2. `confirmed: false` HIDES a notice from both surfaces. That is the
//      mechanism, not a formality — same discipline `testimonials.js` and
//      `home-hero.js` already carry. Draft freely with the flag off.
//   3. Every seed below RESTATES something this site already publishes and has
//      already had reviewed — see each `basis` line, which names where. Not one
//      is a new claim, and that is the only reason they could ship without
//      Clinton writing them.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING: dated announcements ("new rates from…",
// "office closed on…", "offer valid until…"). Those are the notices a real
// board carries and they are Clinton's to write — the shape supports them
// (`date`), and adding one is a one-line content edit. Nothing here fakes one
// in the meantime.
//
// Shape:
//   id        stable key (React key + future analytics)
//   scope     "site" (homepage bar) | "dsc" (board) | "both"
//   label     short mono tag — the practice area, not a severity
//   text      ONE sentence. The bar shows it inline; the board shows it as a
//             row. Long enough to be useful, short enough to read while moving.
//   href      optional — rendered ONLY on the board. The moving bar is
//             deliberately non-interactive; see NoticeTicker's own comment.
//   date      optional DD-MM-YYYY, rendered on the board when present.
//   confirmed false hides it everywhere.
//   basis     where this is already asserted on the site. Not rendered.
