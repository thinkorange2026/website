// PARTNER-WITH-US CONTENT (T6, /partner-with-us) — CONTENT-PLAN.md §10.
//
// ⛔ 02-09-2026 (Clinton): "CA, CS, Tax practitioner[s] don't refer their
// clients. They themselves onboard with us to process the DSC for their
// clients. right now it is writ[ten] in [a] different interpretation."
//
// THIS FILE WAS ENTIRELY REWRITTEN ON THAT NOTE. Every previous sentence
// described a REFERRAL programme — "Refer your clients' DSC needs to us",
// "Commission on referrals", "You refer the requirement to us with your
// client's details; we handle verification, issuance, the token and dispatch".
// That is the opposite of the product. A partner is not handing work over;
// they enrol through ThinkOrange and issue certificates
// THEMSELVES — their own login, their own video verification, their own
// client relationship, their own margin. We enable and support; we do not take
// the client.
//
// ⚠️ THE DISTINCTION IS LOAD-BEARING IN THE COPY, not a matter of tone. If a
// sentence could be read as "send your client to ThinkOrange", it is wrong.
// The tell is the verb: partners ISSUE, they do not REFER.
//
// Structure and much of the wording follow the reference Clinton supplied
// (thinkorange-dsc-usecase-pages.html). ⛔ THAT FILE MARKS ITS OWN UNCONFIRMED
// FIGURES with a `.tbc` class and carries two explicit "Note to ThinkOrange"
// blocks saying they need real values before publishing. Every one of those is
// therefore ABSENT here:
//   - the commission percentage (`[X]%`)
//   - login activation time (`[X hrs]`)
//   - retail price ranges and margin percentages in the earnings table
//   - "we reply within one working day" — a turnaround commitment, so it comes
//     from `turnaround.js` (`enquiryResponseTime`, value null) like every other
//     one on this site, never typed in.
// What the reference asserts WITHOUT a tbc mark is Clinton's own claim and is
// carried over: no joining fee, no minimum volume, your own login, your
// clients stay yours, free onboarding, partner-rate tokens, English and Tamil
// support. See MISSING-PAGES.md for the two that still want a human check.

  // Clinton supplied this section's copy verbatim and a reference layout (a
  // bento: one tall card beside two small tiles and one wide one), so `whyUs`
  // below is now a SHAPED object rather than a flat list — the page renders
  // `lead` as the tall card and `tiles` as the three beside it.
  //
  // ⚠️ Order is load-bearing: `tiles` renders small, small, WIDE. A fourth
  // entry breaks that composition rather than wrapping neatly.
  //
  // Every claim here is Clinton's own, given directly, and none carries a
  // number: "direct commissions" without a percentage (the reference's own
  // `[X]%` is still unconfirmed — see this file's header), "no bulk token
  // purchase" rather than a rupee floor.
  //
  // ⚠️ ONE claim is worth a second look: "Instant in-house issuance" is
  // Clinton's own wording and is a SPEED claim. It is published as given
  // because it describes a mechanism rather than a guarantee — a partner
  // raises the application from their own login, so there is no vendor step to
  // wait on — and the body deliberately says that instead of naming a
  // turnaround. Do NOT let a future edit turn it into "issued in X hours";
  // that is `turnaround.js`'s territory and the value there is still null.

  //    documents or Mail/WhatsApp to us and we will create their account."
  //
  // So this section answers two questions the onboarding timeline never did —
  // WHAT to have, and HOW to actually send it — and it offers both routes.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE DOCUMENT LIST IS NOT RESTATED HERE. `DocumentsRequired` renders
  // `registrationDocuments` above by reference, the same "select, do not fork"
  // discipline the homepage FAQ row and the DSC validity page already follow.
