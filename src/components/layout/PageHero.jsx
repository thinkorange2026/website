// Shared compact dark hero for T2 (service leaf) and T3 (category hub) —
// CONTENT-PLAN.md §7 row 1 and §8 row 1 ("Same as T2 hero"). Breadcrumb, H1,
// one-line copy and an inline CTA over a single static arc — no cursor
// bloom, no scroll-linked motion, so it stays cheap across the 40+ pages that
// render it.
//
// Satisfies the layout contract: full-bleed to y=0 via `.page-top`, dark
// surface so the fixed transparent header's canvas-coloured text stays
// legible over it (CLAUDE.md "Layout contract").
//
// `children` (Phase 7): T5 utility pages need their download buttons
// "immediately" above the fold (CONTENT-PLAN.md §9) — inside this hero
// rather than in a separate section below it, and WITHOUT the `cta` link
// button (T5 is "no marketing chrome"). Optional and additive.
//
// --- 20-08-2026, DSC premium pass -----------------------------------------
// Three more optional props, all additive. Pass none of them and the rendered
// output is byte-identical to before, which is what the ~40 non-DSC routes
// rely on:
//
//   `texture`  — a SurfaceTexture variant (theme.css `.surface-texture`)
//                rendered INSTEAD of the single static arc, plus
//                `.surface-ambient`'s radial so the fold is not a flat slab.
//                §7.2 is explicit that dark surfaces "are not flat #0B1329";
//                the other 40 heroes still are, and can take the same prop
//                one at a time — deliberately not switched on for all of them
//                inside a DSC-scoped change.
//   `aside`    — right-hand column. Switches the hero to a 7/5 grid.
//   `spec`     — [{ label, value }] hairline row beneath, for DERIVED facts
//                only (counts, "On request", partner names already asserted in
//                content). Never a number that would need confirming — this
//                row is exactly where an invented client count or turnaround
//                would be easiest to slip in.
//
// `textureId` must be unique per mounted hero — `url(#id)` resolves
// document-wide, not per-<svg>.
//
// --- 21-08-2026 ------------------------------------------------------------
// `ringsId` is a third, additive backdrop option, alongside the default single
// crescent and `texture`. Pass a unique id and the hero renders `ArcRings` —
// the concentric, gradient-faded set the CtaBand and the /dsc sections already
// use — instead of the lone flat arc.
//
// The lone arc is a single 16px stroke at a flat 12% ember, hung off the
// corner at a size that puts its brightest section behind the fixed header. On
// a page with no other backdrop it does not read as a corner composition; it
// reads as one dull circle that has been cut off. `ArcRings` fixes that by
// construction rather than by nudging: the shared gradient fades each stroke
// along its own length, so the composition resolves into the surface instead
// of ending at the clip edge, and two radii read as depth where one reads as
// an object. Same crescent geometry either way (`lib/arc.js`), so §3.1's "one
// specific shape" still holds.
//
// Default stays the single arc — the other ~40 heroes are byte-identical
// unless they opt in.

  //
  // `margin="0px"` on ALL of them, not just the spec row: `Reveal`'s default
  // -12% bottom root-shrink exists to stop a below-the-fold section firing the

  // ⚠️ TRADEOFF, stated rather than hidden: this puts `opacity: 0` on the H1 in

  // homepage's Typewriter. It was measured after this change (see CLAUDE.md);
  // if a T5 driver page ever misses CONTENT-PLAN.md §9's LCP < 1.2s target,
  // the fix is to drop the H1's opacity from its `Reveal` and let it rise only.
