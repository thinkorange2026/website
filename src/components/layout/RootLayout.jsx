  // DSC column, the retired-DSC redirect stubs and, as of today, the whole
  // Digital Signatures mega panel, whose items are all deep links into a
  // section of /dsc or /dsc/buy-token. React Router changes the URL without a
  // document load, so the browser never performs its own fragment scroll and
  // this effect then scrolled the reader back to the top of a page they had
  // asked to enter halfway down. A same-page anchor was unaffected, which is
  // why it went unnoticed.
  //
  // ⚠️ The RETRY is not defensive padding. Every page template is
  // `React.lazy`-loaded (Phase 7), so on a cross-page navigation the target
  // section does not exist in the DOM on the frame this effect first runs —
  // one `getElementById` would miss on exactly the case this exists for.
  // `scroll-mt-*` on the targets supplies the fixed header's clearance, so

  // ⛔ 21-09-2026 — marks the document with whether WebGL is hardware-backed,
  // so CSS can withhold the expensive hero animations from machines that
  // would have to rasterise them on the CPU. See src/lib/gpu.js for the
  // measurements and theme.css's `html:not([data-gpu="hw"])` block for what
  // this actually gates.
  //
  // Measured on the production build under `--use-angle=swiftshader`: with
  // `.hero-image-drift` and `.hero-card-float` running the page holds ~28fps;
  // with just those two stopped it holds 59.9fps, while the typewriter, the
  // notice marquee, the image skeletons and the chevron all keep animating.
  // Two large animated layers, ~15ms of software raster each, every frame.
  //
  // ⚠️ An ATTRIBUTE, not React state, on purpose: nothing re-renders, so this
  // costs one DOM write and no reconciliation, and CSS can scope to it
  // directly. The attribute is absent in the prerendered HTML and until this
  // effect runs, and the CSS treats "absent" as "no GPU" — so the animations
  // start a beat late on real hardware rather than running for a beat on a
  // machine that cannot afford them. That is the right way round: they are

            and it is a bug fix, not a preference (22-08-2026).

            React reconciles by element TYPE and POSITION. Two service leaves
            are two different routes but both render <ServiceLeaf> at the same
            depth, so React kept the SAME component instance and only changed
            its props — which meant every `useInView(..., { once: true })`
            latch inside `Reveal`, `Stagger` and `SectionHeading` survived the
            navigation already flipped to true. The new page's content
            therefore appeared fully opaque with no reveal at all, and any
            wrapper that happened to be latched stayed latched forever.

            Measured on /services/gst/registration -> /services/gst/return-filing:
            a hard load starts with 23 of 30 reveal wrappers hidden; after the
            in-app navigation only 6 were, and scrolling the new page never
            revealed anything because there was nothing left to trigger.

            Keying by pathname makes an in-app navigation behave like a fresh
            load: new instances, fresh observers, reveals replay. It also fixes
            the same class of problem for every other template that serves more
            than one route (T3 hubs, T4 products, T5 utility pages, T8 legal,
            T10 articles), not just service leaves.

          FAB's bottom-right corner, where Sonner's default position would
          otherwise stack toasts directly over/behind it. `classNames` maps

          one: a localhost session would report into the same property as real
          traffic and those hits CANNOT be deleted afterwards; and the script
          lives at /_vercel/insights/script.js, which only Vercel's edge
          serves, so in `npm run dev` it 404s and the package logs a failure
          to the console on every page load.
          ⚠️ The package's own dev detection does NOT cover this — it reads
          `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which does not exist in a Vite browser
          bundle, so its try/catch falls through to "production". Gating here
          is what actually works.

          SSR-safe with nothing to guard: the component returns null and does
          all its work in an effect, so it emits no markup during the Phase 9
          `renderToString` pass and cannot cause a hydration mismatch. That is
          why it needs neither `useIdleMount` nor a Suspense boundary, unlike
          the Toaster above. The script it injects is `defer`.

          ⚠️ NO `route` PROP, deliberately. Passing one sets
          `disableAutoTrack` and groups URLs under a pattern — useful for
          `/blog/[slug]`-style sites, wrong here: every one of these 64 routes
          is a distinct page, and the whole question worth answering is which
          service page earns traffic. Auto-tracking reports real paths.

          ⚠️ This is the SECOND analytics tag on the site (GA4 is in
          index.html). Deliberate and Clinton's call, but worth knowing both
          are firing — and see the privacy-policy note below. */}
