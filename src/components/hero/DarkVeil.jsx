// ⚠️ hueShift is NOT a design token and can't be one — it's a rotation angle
// fed to a shader uniform, not a CSS colour, and it does NOT move in step
// with HSL degrees: the shift happens in YIQ space (rgb2yiq / yiq2rgb above),
// a different colour model, so "+116° of uHueShift" does not mean "+116° of
// visible hue" — an early attempt at that arithmetic landed on green, not
// ember. The real value was found empirically: a standalone harness rendered
// this exact shader at uHueShift values across the full 0–360° range,
// weighted-hue-sampled the actual output pixels at each, and searched for
// whichever value's dominant hue landed closest to ember-400's (#F26522,
// ≈19.3° HSL). 225° was the clear, stable minimum — the four values on
// either side of it (217–233°) all land within ~2–8° of the target, not a
// lone spike, so it's not a fluke of one sampled frame.

// Vertical framing, found the same way as the hue shift — by sweeping and
// MEASURING, not by eye. A harness rendered this shader at the hero's real
// 1.6 aspect across scale × offset combinations, averaged four uTime phases
// (the pattern morphs over time, so one frame proves nothing), and reported
// mean brightness per 10% horizontal band from top to bottom.
//
// At vendor defaults (scale 1, offset 0) that profile is
//   [27.7, 30.7, 24.3, 10.7, 2.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0]
// i.e. the pattern is effectively black below 40% of the height — the whole
// reason the effect "showed almost at top". The CPPN's bright region simply
// lives in the upper part of its own coordinate space; nothing was wrong with
// the CSS layers (the vignette was measured and makes almost no difference).
//
// At the chosen values the profile becomes
//   [25.9, 29.4, 30.8, 30.5, 27.5, 21.2, 13.9, 7.6, 3.2, 1.3]
// — full strength through the top ~60%, fading through band 7, effectively
// gone by band 9.
//
// That taper point is not arbitrary. The "Explore Services" button's bottom
// edge was measured across three large viewports and sits at 64–70% of the
// arcfield's height (1600×1000 → 70.0%, 1920×1080 → 68.5%, 2560×1400 →
// 64.3%), and the stat row begins at 76–84%. So the effect reaches the CTA
// pair and then falls away before it can wash behind the stat numbers, which
// is what was asked for. An earlier pass used 0.4/-0.6, which spread energy
// evenly to the very bottom (band 8 still at 17.6) and ran the pattern behind
// the stats.
//
// scale stretches a narrow slice of the pattern over the full height; offset
// slides which slice that is. Re-sweep if the shader source changes, and
// re-check the button fraction if the hero's internal spacing changes.
