// ⛔ WHY THE PANEL USES VARIANTS RATHER THAN INLINE initial/animate/exit.
//
// Reported (20-08-2026, Clinton): on a large screen, moving between Services
// and Digital Signatures made the dropdown BLINK. Measured over CDP — sampling
// both panels' computed opacity every frame through a real pointer move — the
// crossover frame had Services at 0.471 and DSC at 0.380, i.e. combined
// coverage of only 0.672: **a third of the page showed through the menu**, and
// both panels were translating at the same time. Two separate AnimatePresence
// instances each ran their own independent fade, so the outgoing panel emptied
// out before the incoming one had filled in.
//
// The fix has to distinguish a SWITCH from a plain open/close, and the exiting
// element cannot be re-rendered — AnimatePresence animates the LAST element it
// saw, so a `switching` flag read inline from props would be the stale
// pre-switch value. `AnimatePresence`'s `custom` prop exists exactly for this:
// it is re-read at exit time. Hence variants-as-functions, and `custom` passed
// on BOTH the AnimatePresence (for the exiting panel) and the motion.div (for
// the entering one).
//
// The switch transition itself: the incoming panel fades up over 140ms while
// the outgoing one HOLDS AT FULL OPACITY, and only starts fading once the
// incoming has reached opacity 1 and is covering it. Coverage is therefore
// 1 - (1 - a)(1 - 1) = 1 at every frame — the gap is closed by construction,
// not by tuning two durations until it looks acceptable. `seq` as z-index
// guarantees the incoming paints on top however many times the two alternate,
// so the switch always reads as the new panel materialising over the old rather
// than the old one dissolving away first (which looks like lag, since nothing
// happens for 140ms).
//
// Neither panel TRAVELS during a switch: the -6px drop is the gesture of a
// panel coming out of its trigger, and on a switch the surface is already
// there — only its contents change. Under reduced motion no transform is used
// in any state and only opacity moves.
// ⛔ EVERY STATE MUST SPELL OUT translateY AND scale. NEVER "none".
//
// Motion decomposes a transform STRING into its components and interpolates
// each one, and it does not read "none" as "translateY(0) scale(1)" — the scale
// component simply has no value on that side, so animating
// `translateY(-6px) scale(0.995)` → `none` resolved the end state to
// **scale(0)**. Cost real time here: the panel reported `opacity: 1` and a
// computed `width: 1680px`, so every probe said it was open and fully visible,
// while `getBoundingClientRect()` returned 0×0 and the screenshot showed no
// panel at all — `matrix(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`. Only dumping the INLINE transform
// found it. The pre-existing code sidestepped this by writing
// `translateY(0px) scale(1)` explicitly on the animate leg; the same discipline
// is now applied to all three states so the trap cannot come back.

                    hard way when it was a sibling of <nav> instead:

                    1. `navRef` guards the pointerdown-outside handler. With the
                       panel outside it, pressing the mouse on any panel link
                       counted as "outside", called close(), and unmounted the
                       link before the click could land — every link in the mega
                       menu was silently unclickable.
                    2. `handleFocusOut` closes when focus leaves <nav>. Tabbing
                       toward the panel therefore closed it first, so its ~30
                       links were unreachable by keyboard entirely.

                    Sitting here, tab order is trigger -> panel contents -> next
                    nav item with no focus management at all, and both handlers
                    correctly treat the panel as inside the nav. It still
                    positions against <header> (the nearest positioned ancestor —
                    <nav> is static), so the full-bleed geometry is unchanged. */}

                    is part of the exit state: without it, the cursor crossing
