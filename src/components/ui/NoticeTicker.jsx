// The homepage's small infinite notice bar (Clinton, 04-09-2026). One thin
// full-bleed strip, not a section of content — it sits directly under the hero
// and its whole job is to be read in passing.
//
// ⛔ IT IS DELIBERATELY NON-INTERACTIVE — no links in the moving track, even
// though `notices.js` carries `href`. Two reasons, and both are real:
//   1. A link that is physically sliding away is a hostile click target. Hover
//      pause helps a mouse and does nothing for touch.
//   2. The track is DUPLICATED to loop seamlessly, so any focusable element in
//      it exists twice in the tab order pointing at the same place. Marking
//      the copy `aria-hidden` fixes the screen reader and does NOT remove it
//      from the tab order (`inert` would, but then so would the hover pause be
//      pointless).
// The `/dsc` NoticeBoard is the surface that renders `href`. Keep it that way.
//
// ⚠️ SURFACE IS `light-alt`, and that is a cadence constraint rather than a
// look. The homepage hero is `deep`; a dark or deep bar directly beneath it
// would be two adjacent dark-family surfaces, which read as one slab with no
// fold — the exact fault Clinton reported on /dsc on 02-09-2026 and which a
// cadence check comparing adjacent TOKENS passes, because the tokens differ.
// The section below this one is `light`, so `light-alt` also avoids a repeat.

// ⚠️ ONE GROUP MUST BE AT LEAST AS WIDE AS THE WIDEST WINDOW THIS EVER RENDERS
// IN. `translateX(-50%)` travels exactly one group, so at the loop point the
// trailing group has to still cover the whole visible strip — otherwise there
// is dead space behind the last item before it snaps back, which reads exactly
// as "it finishes, then starts again". This bar is FULL-BLEED, so the window
// is the viewport, not the 1800px container: budget for ~2560px. Measured at
// 1440px, one pass of the current notices is ~2900px, so 2 passes (~5800px)
// clears a 2560px window with room to spare. Re-check with the probe in this
// file's commit if `notices.js` ever shrinks to one or two short entries.

  // later changed, quietly slowing the strip to ~15px/s until someone noticed.
  // Here the element measures itself, so editing `notices.js` can never leave
  // the speed wrong.
  //
  // Written straight to the DOM in an effect rather than through state: it
  // must not differ between the server render and the client's first pass, or
  // it is a hydration mismatch. SSR and first render both use the CSS default.
