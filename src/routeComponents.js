// Maps a nav.js route entry to its template component — the one piece of
// logic router.jsx (client, lazy chunks) and router-static.jsx (Phase 9 SSR,
// eager imports) must share rather than each maintaining its own copy of the
// same switch statement. A route resolving to the wrong template in one but
// not the other is exactly the kind of drift neither file's own build would
// catch — the client bundle would render fine, and the prerendered HTML
// would silently be for the wrong page.
//
// Takes the actual components as a parameter rather than importing them
// itself, so each caller controls HOW its components are loaded (lazy vs.
// eager) without this file caring. No JSX here on purpose — kept a plain .js
// module so nothing about it depends on react-jsx transform specifics.
